# ILRI Climate Adaptation Effectiveness
Evidence synthesis and systematic reviews on climate change and agri-food systems  
Project Title: **“Measuring what matters: tracking the effectiveness of climate adaptation for smallholder producers”**

This repository hosts the methods, protocols, documentation, data workflows, analysis scripts, and outputs for the ILRI consultancy focused on tracking and assessing the effectiveness of climate adaptation interventions for smallholder producers.  
The project includes a scoping review, a systematic map, and a systematic review/meta-analysis, following CEE, Cochrane, and Campbell Collaboration standards.

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to systematically identify, map, and assess methods used to track and measure the effectiveness of climate adaptation actions for smallholder producers within agri-food systems.  
The project incorporates stakeholder engagement, transparent reporting, reproducible workflows, and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data practices.

## Key Objectives
1. Identify and map existing methods used to evaluate the effectiveness of climate adaptation interventions for smallholder producers.  
2. Conduct a rigorous scoping review and systematic map to characterize the evidence base.  
3. Conduct a systematic review/meta-analysis to synthesize findings.  
4. Engage stakeholders to ensure relevance, transparency, and uptake.  
5. Develop searchable datasets, evidence gap maps, and reproducible workflows.  
6. Produce final publication-ready outputs, including manuscripts and policy-relevant summaries.
