AB  - Abstract Climate change is affecting crop production in the West Africa Sahel. Farmers develop many adaptation strategies However, few of them have been tested to find their climate smartness, primarily their agronomic and economic benefits. Therefore , this study aimed to evaluate the field experiment in two successive years, 2020 and 2021, in rainy conditions, the combined effect of millet/cowpea intercropping and fertilizer microdosing on the yield and their economic advantages. Two genotypes of cowpea (ISV128 and Tiligré) and a variety of millet, Heini Kirey Précoce (HKP), were intercropped. At the treatment level, there is a net benefit of the crop association compared to the pure cultivation of each of the millet and cowpea species with total LERs, an average of 1.48 in 2020, and 1.43 in 2021 for microdose treatment and 1.55 in 2020 and 1.13 in 2021 for the control. However, there is no significant difference in cowpea genotype on LER and millet yields in the 2 years (P = 0.65 in 2020 and 0.29 in 2021). Yields of millet and cowpea were higher in the sole crop than in intercropping. The intercropping showed a significantly higher monetary advantage than the sole millet crop in both years. ISV128 is the most profitable because it is less competitive and less aggressive in intercropping with millet and offers a considerable monetary advantage. The findings are invaluable in implementing resilience strategies for smallholders who must be encouraged to adopt these cultural practices due to global warming.

AB  - A survey was conducted between April and July 2007 to generate information on dry season feeding management and livestock poisoning in the southern rangelands of Ethiopia. A total of 119 pastoralists were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire. Moreover, additional information was obtained through informal discussions. The study revealed that pastoralists have rich knowledge of natural resource management and utilization and employ various strategies such as migration, collection of grasses and pods, and cutting branches to overcome feed scarcity during dry/drought periods. Migration of livestock and people to areas with better grazing is the widely used strategy. However, the implementation of this strategy is diminishing as a result of changes such as bush encroachment, expansion of settlements, and crop cultivation in dry-season grazing lands. The respondents also indicated the presence of poisonous plants in the rangeland, and about 20 such plants were identified by the respondents. Various species and classes of livestock are reported to be affected by toxic plants particularly in the dry and early rainy seasons when feed is in short supply. A more extensive survey is required to document all poisonous plants in the rangelands and to identify the major toxic principles in the different species. Future development interventions should consider the prevailing constraints and potentials of the rangelands with active participation of the pastoralists.

AB  - This paper analyses the effect of an adapted – more participatory and more integrated – mass mobilization training approach on Ethiopian farmers' motivation to practice integrated farming and invest in Sustainable Land Management (SLM). It is based on the results of an experiment carried-out in the Sago-kara watershed in the Central highlands of Ethiopia, in which a group of 26 farmers received an adapted training at the start of the mass mobilization campaign in 2016, which aimed to strengthen farmers' knowledge and awareness about natural resource management, drought mitigation and integrated farm planning. One year later, both qualitative and quantitative data were collected through group discussions, field observations and household surveys. For the before-after comparison we used descriptive statistics to analyze the data; the with-without comparison (with a control group) differences were statistically tested at 1% and 5% probability levels. The results show that the adapted training approach enhanced awareness of farmers, created motivation for integrated farm management and fostered implementation of SLM practices in the field. Most interesting is that farmers who followed the training better plan for drought mitigation and are more aware of the possible effects of drought on their farming activities. The study concludes that the current mass mobilization approach in Ethiopia can have more impact on SLM if it would pay serious attention to: 1) creating awareness on the causes and effects of erosion and drought focusing on sustainability issues, 2) fostering farmers' intrinsic motivation to be good stewards of their land; 3) training in integrated farm planning, and 4) developing farm plans based on farmers’ visions for resilient farming. In order to make agricultural extension in Ethiopia more effective, one has to start with capacity building of the rural extension staff in participatory training methods, followed by empowering and motivating farmers for SLM. This will not only lay a foundation for sustainable agriculture and more food security on the farm, but is also crucial for the scaling-up of resilient farming to watershed and landscape levels in Ethiopia.

AB  - Agriculture places heavy burden on the environment in the process of providing humanity with food and fiber, while climate is the primary determinant of agricultural productivity. Given the fundamental roles of agriculture in human welfare, concern has been expressed by federal agencies and others, regarding the potential effects of climate change on agricultural productivity. The study examined the perceived impact of climate change on the livelihood of arable crop farmers in Southwest, Nigeria. Various strategies adapted to reduce the effect of climate change on their crop and livelihood includes: crop rotation ( $$ \overline{x}=2.68 $$ ), planting of leguminous crop ( $$ \overline{x}=2.05 $$ ), application of organic fertilizers ( $$ \overline{x}=2.28 $$ ), mulching ( $$ \overline{x}=2.38 $$ ) and by planting drought resistance crops ( $$ \overline{x}=2.30 $$ ). Reported among the effects of climate change on crop and farmers’ livelihood were: discoloration of crop leave ( $$ \overline{x}=2.49 $$ ), increase infestation of pests and diseases ( $$ \overline{x}=2.50 $$ ) and reduction of crop yield ( $$ \overline{x}=2.49 $$ ). Experience gathered during the course of research will be useful at both local and international level as a way of reducing climate change threat.

AB  - In the past 20&nbsp;years, very little progress has been achieved in reducing food insecurity, child malnutrition and hunger in Africa. Under-nutrition and micronutrients deficiencies are widespread and affect mainly women and children. To address these problems, increased consumption of African leafy vegetables is promoted as sources of both micronutrients and bio-active compounds. Widely promoted African leafy vegetables include Amaranthus spp., a taxonomic group cultivated worldwide. Species of this genus are used as pseudo-cereals in Europe and America, and are mostly planted as vegetables in Africa. Amaranthus has been rediscovered as a promising food crop mainly due to its resistance to heat, drought, diseases and pests, and the high nutritional value of both seeds and leaves. Leaves are rich in proteins and micronutrients such as iron, calcium, zinc, vitamin C and vitamin A. All parts of the plant are used as medicine to heal many diseases in African communities. This paper focuses on leafy amaranths traditionally utilized on the continent. It briefly reviews the current knowledge on taxonomy, ecology, nutritional and nutraceutical value, production and cultivation systems, reproductive biology, genetic resources and breeding of amaranths. Species of interest include: A. blitum, A. caudatus, A. cruentus, A. dubius, A. hypochondriacus, A. spinosus, A. thunbergii, A. tricolor, and A. viridis. Research and development opportunities on nutritive and nutraceutical properties, production and commercialization, taxonomic evaluation and breeding perspectives were explored.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper was to assess the effects of quality coffee production on climate change adaptation using household surveys and interview data gathered from coffee farmers in Yirgacheffe, southern Ethiopia. Design/methodology/approach A sample of 352 households, stratified into conventional coffee farmers 232 (66%) and specialty coffee producers 120(34%), was used. The propensity score model for participating in quality coffee production was estimated using 14 covariates, and the impact of quality coffee production on adaptation to climate change adaptation was examined. The results are augmented with qualitative data collected through focus group discussions and key informant interviews held with randomly selected smallholder farmers. A telecoupling theoretical perspective was used to understand the link between coffee farmers’ adaptation practices and the demand for quality coffee, as coffee is a global commodity. Findings The PSM analysis reveals that quality coffee production positively influences climate change adaptation. This implies that conventional coffee producers would have performed better in adaptation to climate change if they had participated in quality coffee production. The results of group discussions also confirm the positive effects of quality coffee production on adaptation to climate change, which also suggests a positive spillover effects for sustainable coffee farm management. Practical implications This study suggests enhancing quality coffee production is essential if a more sustainable and climate change resilient coffee livelihood is envisioned. Originality/value Though many studies are available on adaptation to climate change in general, this study is one of the few studies focusing on the effects of quality coffee production on climate change adaptation by smallholders in one of the least developed countries, Ethiopia. This study provides a better understanding of the importance of adaptation strategies specific to coffee production, which in turn help develop a more resilient coffee sector, as coffee production is one of the most sensitive activity to climate change.

AB  - Climate change is a major challenge to agricultural development in Africa and the world at large. Agriculture, being one of the most weather-dependent of all human activities is highly vulnerable to climate change. Horticulture which is therefore an aspect of Agriculture is not an exemption. Farmers had to live with the realities of climate change and be able to manage the situation to maintain their enterprise. Agricultural Development Programme (ADP) structure was adopted to draw a sample of 441 horticultural farmers using multi-stage sampling technique. Four agricultural zones (Southeast, Southwest, Northeast and North central) were purposively selected due to prevalence in horticultural production. From each of these zones, one state each was randomly selected (Oyo, Imo, Gombe and Benue). ADP zones with high production of fruits and vegetables were purposively selected, 25 % of the blocks within the selected zones was randomly selected, 50 % cells within the selected blocks were randomly sampled and 10 % of the respondents from the generated list of fruits and vegetable producers, farmers group were randomly selected. Both quantitative and qualitative methods of data collection were used. Data for the study were analyzed using descriptive and statistics, and T-test at p = 0.05, Mean age of horticultural farmers was 46.0 years ±9.3, 83.9 % were male, and mean family size was 5.8. The modal class of number of years in horticultural production is between 10 and 20 years (41.1 %) with 87.8 % belonging to informal working exchange group. Fifty-six percent of the respondents have low adaptation strategy score. There is significant difference in the use adaptation strategies between (t = −3.391; p < 0.000) citrus and tomato farmers.

AB  - Concerns about mitigating and adapting to climate change resulted in renewing the incentive for agricultural research investments and developing further innovation priorities around the world particularly in developing countries. In the near future, development of new agricultural measures and proper diffusion of technologies will greatly influence the ability of farmers in adaptation and mitigation to climate change. Using bibliometric approaches through output of academic journal publications and patent-based data, we assess the impact of research and development (R&D) for new and existing technologies within the context of climate change mitigation and adaptation. We show that many developing countries invest limited resources for R&D in relevant technologies that have great potential for mitigation and adaption in agricultural production. We also discuss constraints including weak infrastructure, limited research capacity, lack of credit facilities and technology transfer that may hinder the application of innovation in tackling the challenges of climate change. A range of policy measures is also suggested to overcome identified constraints and to ensure that potentials of innovation for climate change mitigation and adaptation are realized.

AB  - Aquaculture is considered a high-risk industry, with production variability significantly hindering the development and implementation of effective risk management strategies. Globally, farms commonly employ multiple risk management approaches simultaneously. However, previous research has largely overlooked the relationship between the decision to adopt risk management techniques and the feasibility of implementing these technologies concurrently. This study uses bivariate and multinomial probit models to analyze the effects of 300 aquaculture producers' decisions to utilize farm management and vertical integration to mitigate farm risks. The research highlights the potential interconnections between different risk management adoption decisions. The results indicate that decisions regarding vertical integration and farm management implementation are related, suggesting that farmers should focus on a variety of risk management techniques to minimize risks. Additionally, the findings underscore the importance of factors such as age, household income, education, extension contact, land ownership status, disease and flood risks, and farmers' risk aversion in influencing the adoption of farm management and vertical integration for risk reduction. The application of probit approaches to standard risk-management tools provides deeper insights, aiding policymakers in developing more effective risk management strategies.

AB  - Despite all the progress in agricultural production over the last decades, small farmers in developing countries are still facing high rates of hunger and poverty. Current global food and agricultural systems have not allowed smallholder farmers to sustain their incomes and improve their livelihoods. Furthermore, conventional agricultural practices have severely degraded the ecosystem’s biodiversity, threatening small farmers’ productivity and their ability to respond to the unpredictable effects of climate change. We urgently need a more equitable and sustainable food and agricultural model that puts human rights at the center: One that not only focuses on increasing productivity but that promotes social justice and human dignity while protecting the environment. Through the lens of the Human Rights-Based Approach (HRBA), this chapter analyzes how Agroecology can better fulfil small farmers’ human rights. Agroecology is defined as a mode of agricultural development that incorporates innovative technologies tailored to local needs in a manner that manages and conserves natural resources while promoting local cultures and community development. Although multiple studies have already highlighted the positive impacts of Agroecology on food production and the environment, limited research has been undertaken to evaluate the connections between agroecological policies and small farmers’ human rights. This chapter seeks to remedy that gap. © 2021 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - In Vanuatu, communities are predicted to be at high risk of more frequent and severe Marine Heat Wave (MHW) impacts in the future, as a result of climate change. A critical sector at risk in Vanuatu is fisheries, which vitally support food security and livelihoods. To sustain local communities, the MHW risk for Vanuatu fisheries must be extensively explored. In this study, an efficient MHW risk assessment methodology is demonstrated specifically for assessing MHW risk to Vanuatu fisheries. The fisheries specific MHW risk assessment was conducted on the local area council scale for two retrospective case study periods: 2015–2017 and 2020–2022. An integrated GIS-based approach was taken to calculating and mapping monthly hazard, vulnerability, exposure, and overall risk indices. Key areas and time periods of concern for MHW impacts are identified. Area councils in the Shefa province area are particularly concerning, displaying consistently high-risk levels throughout both case studies. Risk levels in 2022 were the most concerning, with most months displaying peak risk to MHW impacts. A sensitivity analysis is employed to validate the selection and weighting of the indicators used. However, it is recommended that a more comprehensive validation of the retrospective risk assessment results, using multiple ground-truth sources, be conducted in the future. Once results are sufficiently validated, management recommendations for fisheries resilience can be made.

AB  - ABSTRACT This study examines whether reducing structural constraints to gender equality in agrifood systems, specifically those related to norms and access to resources, contributes to women's empowerment in agriculture, more gender-equal climate adaptive capacities and better dietary outcomes for women. We test these hypotheses by examining the effects of a first intervention called ECATTO, which addressed discriminatory norms and attitudes related to gender-based violence and supported women's rights and leadership, and a second intervention, SHOUHARDO III, which addressed gender-unequal access to resources and extension services for agriculture and livestock; both were implemented in the Kishoreganj district, a climate hotspot in Bangladesh. We rely on gender-disaggregated intrahousehold data collected between treatment and control populations in March 2023 and use propensity score matching as a quasi-experimental identification method. Our study findings confirm that challenging structural barriers to gender equality associated with discriminatory gender norms and attitudes and enhancing gender-equal access to resources and extension services support women's empowerment in climate-affected agrifood systems. Enhancing gender-equal access to resources and extension supports more gender-equal adoption of climate-smart agricultural and livestock practices, suggesting a promising avenue to simultaneously improve gender equality and climate-adaptive capacity. Challenging discriminatory norms and attitudes improved women's diet diversity.

AB  - Abstract Climate change is causing serious challenges for smallholder farm households, especially in sub‐Saharan Africa. The overarching objectives of this study are as follows: (i) to estimate household resilience and vulnerability indices, (ii) identify factors that explain these indices and (iii) to examine the impact of climate‐smart agriculture (CSA) on households’ resilience and vulnerability, and (iv) to identify which CSA package performs better in enhancing resilience and reducing vulnerability. For this study, 278 farm households from 4 districts and 8 kebeles from the Central Rift Valley (CRV) of Ethiopia were randomly selected using a three‐stage proportional to size sampling procedure. Cross‐sectional data applying a structured and pretested survey questionnaire was collected for 2020/21 production season. Household resilience and vulnerability indices were estimated using resilience index and measurement analysis and indicators approaches, respectively. Multinomial endogenous switching regression was used to estimate the average treatment effects (ATEs) of the adoption of CSA practices on households’ resilience and vulnerability. The results show that livestock holding, land size, level of education, and state of food consumption are major explaining factors of resilience, whereas educational level of households, livestock holding, and access to credit are found to be major factors explaining vulnerability. The estimated ATEs indicate that households which adopted more diversified combinations of CSA packages were more resilient and less vulnerable than non‐adopter households. The impacts of soil fertility management and conservation agriculture practices have better performance in improving resilience, whereas conservation agriculture and small‐scale irrigation performed better in reducing the vulnerability of rural households in CRV. Boosting resilience and reducing vulnerability, hence, requires scaling up CSA among smallholder farmers by diversifying and raising farm households’ income, educational status, and livestock holding.

AB  - Small landholders in Pakistan’s high mountainous regions face significant challenges in adapting to the impacts of climate change. This study investigates the adaptation strategies employed by smallholder farmers to address these challenges and identifies the household-level factors influencing these strategies in Nagar Valley. Using a quantitative approach, data were collected through a structured survey involving 430 households. Data are analyzed using bivariate and probit regression models. The study reveals that smallholder farmers adopt various strategies to cope with climate change, including using chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and insecticides, practicing crop rotation, and transitioning to horticulture. The findings of the multivariate probit model demonstrate a significant association between age, gender, education, and the likelihood of adopting adaptation strategies. The study advocates for developing context-specific climate adaptation strategies tailored to these regions’ unique agroecological zones to enhance small landholders’ resilience against climate change impacts. It also emphasizes the need to raise awareness among smallholders about modern, climate-smart agricultural practices and adaptive strategies.

AB  - Droughts affect more people than any other natural hazard and Afghanistan is the hotbed of droughts with millions of lives affected annually. Therefore, this research was carried out to assess farmers' perceptions of climate change and droughts, drought severity, impact of droughts on crop productivity, and farmers' adaptation strategies to buffer the effect of drought using primary data collected through farmer survey, and climate change analysis using the secondary data. Finally, farmers' perceptions of climate and drought were compared with meteorological data using data from both primary and secondary sources. The primary data were gathered using a pretested and structured questionnaire from 120 sampled farmers in the rainfed and irrigated areas of Bamyan Province of Afghanistan. The secondary data regarding climatic variables were used for climate change analysis. The study findings revealed farmers’ perceptions of an increase in average temperature and a decline in average precipitation during 1998–2017, which was corroborated by climate change analysis using actual meteorological data. The perceptual drought severity also matched closely with climate data, though the rainfed area experienced a significantly higher drought frequency and severity compared with the irrigated area. The findings disclosed a significantly lower drought-induced crop productivity in both areas, though the decline was substantially higher in the rainfed area. The drought adaptation strategies included various on-farm and off-farm strategies, which differed significantly in the rainfed and irrigated areas. The on-farm adaptations encompassed early sowing, crop diversification, sowing of drought-tolerant varieties, and leaving fallow land. The off-farm strategies included handicrafts, wage labor, migration, and income diversification. The differences found in adaptation strategies across physical environments highlight the necessity of localized adaption strategies. This study provides evidence-based policy inputs for drought mitigation management in Afghanistan.

AB  - Climate change constitutes a major threat to agricultural production, food security, and natural resource management. Saudi Arabia is particularly susceptible to increasing temperatures and extreme climatic events, such as arid weather and drought. The purpose of this study is to assess farmers’ beliefs and concerns as regards climate change. Extensive interviews were conducted with 164 farmers in the Jazan region. Results revealed that 89.6% of the farmers believed that climate change is due to human activities and 93.3% believed that it is because of natural change. Seventy-five percent of the farmers were concerned about insects and 73% about the prevalence of weeds on their farms. Findings of cluster analysis revealed that farmers who are more likely to believe in climate change are more in agreement with the role of extension services in capacity building. Farmers’ beliefs about climate change were significantly influenced by membership of agricultural cooperatives, access to loans, use of extension services, age, farm size, and level of soil fertility. Access to loans was the only significant factor to explain the differences in farmers’ concerns. These results suggest the need for capacity-building activities targeted at improving farmers’ adaptability to manage climate variability.

AB  - Concerns over the potential harmful impacts of changing climate are strongly echoing around the globe. With its wide range of hazards to human societies, climate change is posing serious threats to human survival and impacting every aspect of human life, including food production systems. It is, therefore, imperative to gauge the local knowledge, perceptions, and adaptation capacity for the effective mitigation of the ill impacts of climate change. In this backdrop, the present study has been designed to investigate the perceptions of farmers regarding causes and impacts of climate change on agriculture. Required data were collected from the Madinah region in Saudi Arabia and analyzed to answer the following study questions: How do farmers perceive impacts of climate change? What factors affect their perceived impacts of climate change? Additionally, what factors affect their perception about the causes of climate change? Individual logit models were used to assess the impacts of various factors on perceived causes and perceived impacts of climate change on agriculture. A multinomial logit model was also employed to figure out significant determinants of perceived causes of climate change on agriculture. Results indicated that the most dominant perceived impacts of climate change are its effects on crop production, followed by drying water sources. The results also revealed that the age of the farmers had a positive effect on their perception of natural processes being the cause of climate change. Similarly, farming experience had an inverse effect on their perceptions regarding causes of climate change. The majority of the farmers seemed clear about the possible drivers of climate change in the country. In particular, about 79 percent of the farmers believed that GHGs and pollution are causing climate change in the country. The findings provide useful insights into farmers’ perceptions about causes and impacts of climate change and may be used by policymakers to strategically design extension and agricultural development initiatives for helping the farmers to implement sustainable agricultural practices to adapt to and lower the adverse impacts of climate change in the Kingdom.

AB  - Populus species have been extensively cultivated in different regions around the world due to their growth performance, easy vegetative propagation and wood properties (for lumber, pulp, fiberboard and plywood). Stability analysis is important for forest breeding programs aimed at obtaining high yield genotypes with greater adaptability for a wide range of environments. However, its application in woody species is scarce in comparison to the usual approach for annual crops. Our objective was to study the productivity and stability of poplar clones across different environmental conditions, and to compare two different methods to characterize yield stability. We used data obtained from trials across sites with different environmental conditions in Paraná River Delta, South America. The studied clones were the most used in the region, Populus deltoides W. Bartram ex Marshall ‘Australiano 129/60’, ‘Carabelas INTA’, ‘Stoneville 67’ and Popupus x canadensis Moench ‘Ragonese 22 INTA. We analyze their growth response in long-term trials under field conditions in a context of high environmental heterogeneity such as the leveed systems of the studied region. Yield stability (volume/ha) of poplar clones was evaluated at eight years old from parameters of Joint Linear Regression Analysis (regression coefficient bi and squared deviations from the mean δij), and with a simplified Relative Distance Plasticity Index (RDPIs) assuming that lower RDPIs implies greater genotype yield stability. This comparison highlighted the usefulness of RDPIs to estimate yield stability regardless of the set and number of involved genotypes. The amplitude of yield between sites demonstrated a great environmental heterogeneity and the significance of genotype x environment interactions. These genotypes were selected clones but had great differences in stability and yield. Thus they were classified as stable genotypes of high yield (‘Australiano 129/60’) and low yield (‘Stoneville 67’) and unstable genotypes of high yield (‘Carabelas INTA’) and low yield (‘Ragonese 22 INTA’). The description of ‘Australiano 129/60’ as stable genotype of high yield is consistent with the empirical perception of forest farmers and explains the prevalence of this clone in the poplar plantations at the Paraná River Delta. However, ‘Carabelas INTA’ an unstable genotype was the best alternative for the most productive conditions. Thus, evaluating yield stability was relevant for both strategies, the selection of high yield stable genotypes and to identify the best genotype for a specific environment. Moreover, the combination of them according to site conditions and resource availability could improve the yield at a stand or regional level. Yield stability analysis should be considered as selection criteria of new clones in Populus breeding programs considering the range of site conditions and the potential impact of climate change on forest plantations.

AB  - This study explores the factors associated with the cultivation of neglected and underutilized crop species (NUS) and agroecology adoption (crop rotation with legumes) amid the climate crisis in rural Lebanon and Morocco. A mixed-methods approach (interviews and questionnaire survey) was used. Five key informant interviews as well as a survey of 923 farmers: 465 in Lebanon (242 men and 223 women) and 458 in Morocco (238 men and 220 women) were conducted. This paper addresses two key questions: (1) what are the predictors of agroecology and NUS cultivation, and (2) what are the primary gendered NUS varietal preferences of farmers and why? Using insights from feminist political ecology, and applying logistic regression analysis, key predictors of adoption include gender, with Moroccan women more likely to adopt agroecology, and age, as older farmers in Morocco are less likely to engage. In Lebanon, marital status influences adoption, with divorced or widowed farmers more engaged in NUS cultivation. Education and wealth also play significant roles, with higher levels of both positively associated with agroecology and NUS adoption. Amid the climate crisis, men and women farmers both indicated that traits like drought resistance and suitability for low rainfall conditions are key drivers for NUS and agroecology adoption. Some key reasons for NUS varietal preferences included, market demands, the need to reduce burden on women, taste and cooking qualities, and to adjust to the climate. Farmers, especially women, also indicated importance of flour blending in their uptake of barley cultivation. These findings highlight the complex motivations behind NUS varietal selection, and the importance of context-specific strategies to support sustainable agriculture in the MENA region.

AB  - Mali is a major livestock producing country in West Africa. However, in recent years, the sector has faced multiple challenges like farmer-herder conflicts, overuse of grazing and water resources, and the effects of climate change. Meanwhile, traditional livestock systems are becoming less important given the increased availability of vehicular transport for regional and international animal trade as well as new opportunities for more specialised urban and peri-urban production systems. To assess the role of Mali’s capital city Bamako for livestock consumption and trade, this study examined the scale of livestock movement in the city, comprising influxes, outfluxes, and transits. To this end, flows of cattle, small ruminants, and livestock feed were recorded through road surveys covering three different seasons. The results showed the role of Bamako as a major trade hub in the distribution of ruminants. While traffic of cattle and sheep was regional, movement of goats was smaller and more localised. Religious festivals were an important driver of livestock traffic, both in terms of the numbers of livestock and the distance covered. This study highlights the role of cities for livestock mobility and contributes to a better understanding of challenges related to urban livestock production and trade and its requirements for better livestock management.

AB  - The inadequacies of weather reporting systems, in remote areas of operations, have left fish farmers and fishermen unprepared and extremely vulnerable to climate change. Thus, the actors along the value chains, in the fisheries and aquaculture, in Nigeria are increasingly affected with devastating flooding. The effects result in the loss of investments in fisheries and aquaculture and properties. In order to ameliorate the loss of fish, incomes, investment, and livelihoods, the fish farmers and fishermen developed local grassroots strategies to cope with the annual escalating effects of flooding.The review of the coping strategies and preventive measures, citing examples, became necessary to appraise their effectiveness and the possibility of scaling up for wider coverage. The likelihood factors and adaptive (indigenous) strategies practiced were assessed. It was found that though they have developed adaptation strategies such as the use of wire gauze and nets to cover the ponds during flooding, reinforcement of pond walls, and embankments, poor understanding and awareness about flooding prevented most fish farmers, especially, from taking the necessary precautionary measures. The chapter therefore advocates, among the fishermen, fish farmers, and supervising authorities, better coordination, ownership, and leadership in improving on the use of local adaptation strategies.

AB  - Climate change is adversely affecting communities of the developing countries because their livelihoods rely mainly on climate-dependent activities. In Tunisia, farm households are facing several climate-driven risks including drought, which ends up with a decrease in their farm productivity and therefore threatens their livelihood subsistence. However, there is a knowledge gap on how household livelihoods are vulnerable and how this vulnerability varies among them. The main purpose of the paper was to assess the households’ livelihood vulnerability to climate change in Medenine province of South-East Tunisia using the Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI). Data were gathered using a monitoring system with 39 reference farms identified by a typology carried out with the data of 2185 farm households from the last survey of farm structures in Medenine-Tunisia. The typological approach identified four farm households’ types: T1: livestock farming with family labor, T2: livestock farming with waged labor, T3: plant production with family labor, and T4: plant production with waged labor. Using the LVI method, results suggest that T1 and T3 are more vulnerable, particularly about knowledge and skills, farm capital, finances, institutional aspects, social network, and water. The findings of the study could help policymakers in designing specific adaptation measures to reduce the household’s vulnerability. The government should give specific attention to T1 and T3 households through: (i) establishing a mechanism that distribute aids to the most affected households, (ii) sustaining the households’ livelihoods by improving water supply and encouraging crop diversification and seed production, and (iii) developing an early warning system for climate extremes.

AB  - The current study assessed the climate change impa cts on land productivity of major food and non-food grain crops in India. We compiled panel data for 30 years (1980-2009) using fifteen crops across thirteen agriculture int ensive states. The value of production for each crop is estimated by farm harvest price (at co nstant prices, 1993-1994). Aggregate value of production on per hectare land is regresse d with different socio-economic and climatic factors using the Cobb-Douglas (C-D) produ ction function model. Estimates based on Driscoll-Kraay standard errors and linear regression and correlated Panels Corrected Standard Errors (PCSEs) (Prais-Winsten) e stimation indicate that land productivity decreases with increase in annual aver age maximum temperature. The study concludes that Indian policymakers need to increase more irrigation facilities and fertilizers for cultivation. Land productivity is p ositively associated with irrigation area, number of pump set and application of fertilizers o n per hectare land. In brief, more irrigation facilities; recommended use of fertilize r; more investment in infrastructure; participation of more literate population in agricu ltural activities; government expenditure on agricultural and allied sectors, rur al development, irrigation and flood control would be useful to mitigate the negative ef fect of climate change on agriculture and improve agricultural productivity (land product ivity). Finally, our projected results based on simulation technique showed that climate c hange would cause a decline in land productivity by 48.63 percent by the year 2100 and loss of farmers’ income in India. Keywords: Climatic change, Cobb-Douglas production function m odel, India, Land productivity, State-wise panel.

AB  - Climate variability and change has continued to wreak havoc on the agricultural sector, with small-scale farmers being the most hard-hit. The limited adaptive capacity of small-scale farmers faced with the impacts of climate variability and change principally explains their high level of vulnerability. It is within this framework that this study sought to examine the specific resiliency choices of small-scale farmers faced with climate variability and change in Cameroon, and the plausible policy implications. Data was collected through a survey of 300 small-scale farmer household heads as well as climate data collected from meteorological stations. Data analysis was run on Microsoft Excel 2007 and SPSS 20, employing descriptive and inferential statistics. Findings showed significant fluctuations in climate parameters in recent years. The main resiliency choices of small-scale farmers faced with climate variability and change were on-farm practices (23%), off-farm practices (19%), and agroforestry practices (28%); with 30% of the sampled farmers taking to the no resiliency option. A statistically significant (p < 0.01; p < 0.05; and p < 0.10) causal and non-causal relationship was found to exist between independent variables (household size, age of household head, number of farms, farm size, household income, farm experience, gender, experience of extreme weather events, access to weather information, access to extension services, access to credit, distance to market, access to land, and membership in farming group) and small-scale farmers' practice of different resiliency options faced with climate variability and change. This shows that small-scale farmers' practice of different resiliency options faced with climate variability and change is determined by past experience of extreme weather/climate events as well as socio-economic and institutional factors. On the basis of these findings, it is recommended that policy makers factor in these determinants when taking actions geared towards enhancing small-scale farmers’ resilience to climate variability and change.

AB  - Abstract Nigeria faces severe food security challenges caused by insecurity, flooding, and soil erosion. In the north, insecurity has prevented many farmers from accessing their farms, while in the south, especially in Anambra State, gully erosion is causing a severe menace not only to farmers and their farmlands but also to properties, and even social infrastructures in the state are not spared. Many research studies have been carried out on soil erosion and gullies in Anambra State, and solutions have been suggested, yet the menace continues. There are also conflicting reports from researchers about the actual number of gully erosion sites in Anambra State including disparities in the estimated soil erodibility in the state. This study analysed and mapped the susceptibility of soils to rainfall erosivity (high, medium, and low) and gully erosion sites in Anambra State. It reveals that the differences in erodibility result from sources of soil data and their spatial resolution. Climatically, the state falls within Koppen’s Af region, with the mean annual temperature and rainfall of around 27°C and 1,870 mm, respectively. The data requirements for this study were from primary and secondary sources. The primary data include field visits, observations, measurements, photographs, soil specimens, experimentation, and brain sensing. The secondary data sources include the Internet, related literature, soil data from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and satellite images. Geographic information system-based analyses were done using ArcGIS 10.4.1. The results are presented in two-dimensional topographic raster and vector overlaid maps of Anambra State, showing the geological formations, areas in the state with high-, medium-, and low-susceptibility to soil erodibility, and the existing gully erosion sites in the state.

AB  - Climate change is predicted to decrease crop yields in semi-arid and subtropical regions of the world and this could negatively affect smallholder farmers in the developing world. Previous analysis has suggested that with low fertiliser input, yields of sorghum increased as temperatures increased. We used the wide range of tropical environments in the small mountainous island country of Timor-Leste to evaluate the impact of global warming on maize (Zea mays) yields with (i) no fertiliser input and (ii) increased nitrogen (N) supply. We calibrated the well-tested APSIM-Maize model for the cultivar of maize grown throughout Timor-Leste. We simulated maize yields at four locations with 8 years of reliable weather records, at present temperatures, +1.5°C and +3.0°C, with 0, 40 and 80 kg/ha of added N, with 1.2, 1.9 and 3.8% soil organic carbon (SOC), and with increased duration of the vegetative phase. With no added N, higher temperatures increased yields at the cooler, higher elevation sites and decreased yields at the warmest site near the coast. With fertiliser application, warming temperatures decreased yields or induced no change in simulated yield at all locations. Simulations with three levels of N supply for the four sites, which differed in temperature, showed a strong temperature × N supply interaction on yield. At maximum growing-season temperatures &gt;31°C, yields decreased with increasing temperature at all levels of fertilisation. At maximum growing-season temperatures of 23-31°C, yields increased with increasing temperature with no added fertiliser, were unchanged with the application of 40 kg N/ha, and decreased with increasing temperatures with application of 80 kg/ha N. The changes in yield with temperature and N supply were associated with N uptake by the maize, which showed the same interaction with maximum temperature and N added. SOC acted as a source of N, so that changes in yield induced by temperature and N were similar whether the N was from an organic or an inorganic source. Increasing the duration of the vegetative phase resulted in lower or no change in yields at all sites. We conclude that global warming will increase the yield for low-input smallholder farmers growing maize at maximum growing-season temperatures &lt;31°C, but that micro-dosing with N will increase yields at all locations with mean maximum temperatures of 20-35°C.

AB  - Odisha is frequently affected by climate extremes such as cyclones and floods. In response, farmers take various adaptation measures to minimise the negative economic impact of these extreme events. The present study analyses the current adaptation strategies of the farm households and the inputs from the analysis can potentially help the future policies aimed at scaling up adaptation strategies to be more effective. A survey of 285 farm households was conducted in three cyclone- and flood-prone districts of Odisha. The study identifies various farm-level adaptation measures and their determinants. The determinants were agricultural extension, access to Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, received crop loss compensation and access to informal credit. It is concluded that the adaptation policy and investment decisions should take into account these determinants in order to enhance the adaptive capacity of the rural farmers in the cyclone- and flood-prone regions of the state.

AB  - ABSTRACT Rising temperatures in Africa present an increasing threat to agricultural productivity and public health, particularly among subsistence farming communities reliant on rain-fed agriculture. Heat exposure can impair farmers’ work capacity, disrupt harvests, and heighten health risks, especially for young children vulnerable to undernutrition. The Heat to Harvest (H2H) study investigates how environmental heat exposure influences farmers’ physiological and behavioral responses, and how these in turn affect harvest yields and child nutrition. It also examines differences in labor performance and recovery between households with and without cool roof coatings, although this intervention is not the central focus. H2H is designed as a prospective cohort study nested within two Health and Demographic Surveillance Systems (HDSS) in Nouna, Burkina Faso, and Siaya, Kenya. The study integrates environmental monitoring (temperature and humidity sensors used to compute Wet Bulb Globe Temperature), biometric data (via wearables tracking heart rate, temperature, physical activity, energy expenditure, and sleep), and GPS tracking (capturing spatial mobility and labor duration). The study is embedded within a larger cluster-randomized controlled trial, facilitating comparative analysis under varying thermal conditions. Findings will provide evidence-based insights into how climate-related heat stress affects health and agricultural outcomes, supporting the development of targeted adaptation strategies to enhance resilience, health, and food security in vulnerable farming communities. Paper context Main focus This methods paper outlines the approach to studying heat exposure’s impact on subsistence farmers’ work capacity in Burkina Faso and Kenya, and its effects on crop yields and child nutrition. Added knowledge It introduces a novel framework combining wearable technology and remote sensing to assess the physiological and agricultural effects of heat stress in vulnerable farming communities. Global health impact for policy and action The study aims to inform climate-resilient agricultural policies and heat-adaptation strategies to protect farmer health and ensure food security in regions facing increasing heat exposure.

AB  - The increase in global population, climate changes, shrinking farmland, and liberalization in trade are driving traditional agriculture to adopt emerging technologies to ensure food and nutritional security for the global population. To simulate crop attributes, this research introduces non-destructive plant phenotyping techniques based on computer vision and deep learning. A smart agri-field management system also has been proposed in this research for crop life cycle traits modelling and monitoring to foster agricultural productivity with lesser work effort. Emerging technologies like unmanned aerial vehicles, the Internet of Things, computer vision, and deep learning have been incorporated into the proposed architecture to find a robust and effective explanation for automation with intelligence, remote data collection, efficient analysis methodology, and quick decision-making. A suitable implementation methodology has also been formulated in this article towards fast adaptation of the agri-field management system in India. The AlexNet-based deep neural network architecture has shown a notable performance for crop species detection, growth monitoring, and health identification, with F1-scores of 0.81, 0.98, and 1, respectively.

AB  - The Sudd in South Sudan, formed by the White Nile’s Baḥr al-Jabal section, is one of the largest and most important wetlands in the world. Communities in the region almost exclusively depend on fisheries for food and livelihoods. Although threatened by over-exploitation and habitat changes, fish populations are also affected by climate change. Using semi-structured questionnaires, we assessed fisherfolk’s opinions of how recent variation in climate affected their livelihoods and the environment. Fisherfolk perceived that climate had changed in the past decade and were negatively impacted by this. Interviewees reported average higher temperatures, a greater frequency of floods and droughts, unpredictable timing of seasons, and erratic rainfall. Destruction of fishing villages/camps, loss and damage of fishing equipment, shifts in the fishing calendar, reduction of fish trade, and fish catch declines as well as psycho-social problems were given as the major consequences of climate change. Causes of climate change and variability were perceived to be linked to uncontrolled harvest of forest resources, anger of God and ancestors, and natural variability in climate. Most respondents expressed a desire to adopt more responsible behavior such as planting trees and establishing community nurseries, being educated on climate change risks, and sustainable fisheries management. Our results show that fisherfolk in the Sudd are troubled by climate change impacts on their livelihoods and on fish populations. In South Sudan, climate change has been reported from hydroclimatological data but concrete impacts on people remain largely unknown and of little concern because of recent wars and the poor economy. Our study provides an example of how fisherfolks’ local ecological knowledge (LEK) can be used as an early warning system of the negative impacts on livelihoods and fish populations and support adaptation to the changing climate.

AB  - Food security in sub-Saharan Africa is one of the major issues confronting the continent. Innovative use of fresh water, the world’s scarcest food production resource, is vital for family-run small-holder agricultural systems, which supply up to 80% of the world’s food. Agriculture employs 70% of Tanzania’s rural population and supplies 95% of the country’s food. The goal was to measure the impact of smart drip irrigation kits on smallholder farmers’ resilience and rural poverty in Tanzania. A household survey was conducted using an exploratory sequential design in four districts (Babati, Hai, Kasulu, and Kilosa) in Tanzania. A total of 383 respondents (Micro-investing (MI) farmers, n = 195; control, n = 187) were randomly selected from a pool of 3444 farmers. Partial budgeting and enterprise economic analysis were used for the calculation of gross margins, and multivariate analysis was used for poverty analysis. Gross margin analysis showed that communities using drip-irrigated vegetable farming are more profitable. Partial budgeting analysis showed that micro-irrigation increased the revenue generation for most vegetable varieties. However, multivariate analysis was unable to confirm that household poverty was markedly reduced through the adoption of this technology. Half of the MI farmers could afford an education for their children due to the extra income generated from MI. This investment strategy has the potential to improve smallholder livelihoods and resilience to climate change.

AB  - Abstract Salinity problems induced by irrigation are often presented in the literature as a threat that can only be managed at the irrigation scheme scale by installing subsurface drainage. On the other hand, salinity is a constraint that has often been successfully managed locally by farmers adapting their practices. However, the continuing expansion of irrigation with related water scarcity problems plus the increasing use of groundwater of marginal quality has resulted in a new challenge that is difficult to handle at the farm level only. To assess the dynamics of soil salinity and water quality together with farmers' salinity management practices, we adapted a common approach to analyze two contrasted salinity patterns: a traditional salinity pattern in an oasis (Fatnassa, Tunisia), and a recent sodicity pattern in a large irrigation scheme (Lower Chelif, Algeria). This approach which combines surveys on farmers' perceptions and practices and salinity measurements and geochemical analysis paves the way for more integrated management of salinity problems related to water scarcity.

AB  - Collective action can help individuals, groups, and communities achieve common goals, thus contributing to poverty reduction. Drawing on longitudinal household and qualitative community data, the authors examine the impact of shocks on household living standards, study the correlates of participation in groups and formal and informal networks, and discuss the relationship of networks with access to other forms of capital. In this context, they assess how one form of collective action, iddir, or burial societies, help households attenuate the impact of illness. They find that iddir effectively deal with problems of asymmetric information by restricting membership geographically, imposing a membership fee, and conducting checks on how the funds were spent. The study also finds that while iddir help poor households cope with individual health shocks, but shows that the better-off households belong to more groups and have larger networks. In addition, where households have limited ability to develop spatial networks, collective action has limited ability to respond to covariate shocks. Therefore, realism is needed in terms of the ability of collective action to respond to shocks, and direct public action is more appropriate to deal with common shocks.

AB  - The study assessed prioritized climate smart agricultural (CSA) practices and technologies of household farmers in Southeast, Nigeria. A multi-stage sampling technique was used to isolate 326 household farmers who participated on the study. Data collection was done using research instrument (questionnaire). Both descriptive and inferential statistics were employed for data analysis. Results indicated that majority of the respondents were females, had secondary education, and had household size of 9 persons with a mean age of 48 years and 19 years of farming experience. Temperature variation (3.85), increase in number of sunny days (3.50), increase in amount of rainfall (3.10), variation in rainfall pattern (3.56), decrease in total rainfall (3.21), increase in frequency of heavy rains (2.85), etc were seriously perceived as climate change effects in the area. Again, various prioritized CSA practices and technologies such as growing a single crop, using a mixture of appropriately chosen genotypes of a given species (46.6%), use of quality seeds and planting materials of well-adapted crops and varieties (77.9%), crop rotation and diversity (41.1%) integrated pest management (47.5%), improved water use and management (26.4%), etc. were adopted by the farmers in mitigating climate change effects. Climate threats identified in the area include, decrease in overall productivity due to increased extreme weather events (0.97), decrease in crop production due to changes in average rainfall (0.94), decrease crop production due to increase in temperatures and rainfall variability (0.79), rapid migration of some pests and diseases (0.72), etc. Lack of access to up to-date information (2.88), access to micro-finance and insurance (2.57), access to agricultural input and output markets (2.14), etc. constrained the adoption of CSA practices. Age, education, occupation, years in farming experience further influenced the adoption of CSA practices and technologies. Policy motions in propagating climate change awareness through the mass media were recommended.

AB  - Abstract With global warming, there are growing challenges for raising taurine and composite beef cattle populations in tropical regions, including elevated temperatures, limited forage availability, parasite infestation, and infectious diseases. These environmental factors can trigger specific physiological responses in the developing fetus, which may have long-term implications on its performance. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to assess the influence of naturally induced thermal stress during the gestation period on the subsequent performance of tropical composite beef cattle progeny. Furthermore, we aimed to investigate the impact of genotype-by-gestational thermal environment interaction (G×Eg) on traits under selection pressure in the breeding population. A total of 157,414 animals from 58 farms located in various Brazilian states were recorded for birth weight (BW), preweaning weight gain (PWG), yearling weight (YW), hip height (HH), scrotal circumference (SC), and days to first calving (DFC). We first applied a linear regression model to the BW data, which revealed that the last 40 d of gestation were suitable for calculating the mean temperature humidity index (THIg). Subsequent regression analyses revealed that for every 10-unit increase in THIg, detrimental effects of approximately 1.13% to 16.34% are expected for all traits evaluated. Genetic parameters were estimated through a reaction norm model using THIg as the environmental descriptor. The posterior means of heritability estimates (SD) were 0.35 (0.07), 0.25 (0.03), 0.31 (0.03), 0.37 (0.01), 0.29 (0.07), and 0.20 (0.09) for the direct effect of BW, PWG, YW, HH, SC, and DFC, respectively. These estimates varied along the range of THIg values, suggesting a variable response to selection depending on the thermal environment during gestation. Genetic correlation estimates between more divergent THIg values were low or negative for YW, PWG, and DFC, indicating that the best-performing individuals at low THIg values may not perform as well at high THIg values and vice versa. Overall, thermal stress during gestation impacts the future performance of beef cattle offspring. Our results indicate the need for developing effective breeding strategies that take into account G×Eg effects and the re-ranking of breeding animals along the THIg scale, particularly for traits such as DFC that are highly sensitive to thermal stress.

AB  - Climate change adaptation measures can generate long-term unintended consequences, as this paper demonstrates through an empirical case study of water conflicts at Lake Parón in Peru’s Cordillera Blanca mountain range. This decade-long struggle culminated in 2008 when a coalition of local groups (stakeholders) from the Cruz de Mayo and Caraz communities in the Callejón de Huaylas seized control of the Lake Parón reservoir from a private multinational corporation, Duke Energy. This clash over Parón’s water in the Llullán and Santa River watersheds emerged much earlier than climatic-hydrologic models had predicted, and it occurred, this paper argues, largely because of previously successful climate adaptation measures. The drainage tunnel and floodgates originally installed at Parón in the 1980s to prevent a climate-related outburst flood led to unintended or perverse outcomes because these technological artifacts subsequently allowed a diversity of stakeholders—including rural subsistence farmers, urban residents, national park officials, tourism promoters, the state energy company Electroperú, and Duke Energy—to manage water differently depending on their priorities and the existing governance structures. Neoliberal reforms that altered state-society-environment relations in Peru played a key role in these changing stakeholder power dynamics that were reflected in the management of water infrastructure at Parón. Examining this water conflict that emerged from the unintended effects of climate adaptation demonstrates not only how technology and society are mutually constitutive, but also why the politics of technologies must be considered more carefully in the analysis of social-ecological systems, hydro-social cycles, and climate change adaptation.

AB  - Indigenous people are among the populations most vulnerable to climate change. However, indigenous societies’ potential contributions to addressing climate change and related issues of food security are vast but poorly recognized. The objective of this report is to inform the nutrition and public health communities about the potential contributions of ancient Andean technologies to address these contemporary challenges. Our research examines these ancient farming technologies within the frame of climate change and dietary potential. Specifically, we focus on 4 technologies derived from 3 case studies from Ecuador. These technologies were analyzed using evidence mainly of adaptation to climate change in indigenous-based agriculture. Our examination of these technologies suggests they could be effective mechanisms for adapting to climate change and protecting food sovereignty. Thus, although highly vulnerable to climate change, indigenous peoples in the Andes should also be seen as “agents of change.”

AB  - ABSTRACT Multiple crises have disrupted food systems around the world. The shocks induced by the COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with increased energy prices and shortages of fertilizers and agricultural inputs, have affected farmers everywhere. By applying inductive, qualitative, and comparative research approaches, we investigate the impact of shocks and crises on diverse food systems. Using mixed qualitative methods, we integrate the voices of (n = 25) farmers belonging to agroecology-based local food systems in Peru, Germany, and the United States with the aims of: (i) understanding the different crisis scenarios; (ii) determining the vulnerabilities induced in farmers; and (iii) identifying the responses and coping mechanisms that farmers deploy in response to shocks. The results illustrate how farmers are affected by the combined effects of labor shortages, rising input costs, high energy prices, and climate change. Farmers’ responses to stressors are then analyzed and compared using attributes of food system resilience. Based on our results, we argue that resilience-building is determined not only by the environment in which agroecology is embedded, but also by the responsive capacities of farmers. We emphasize the need for more proactive policies aimed at promoting agroecological and localized production to enhance the resilience of food systems against recurrent shocks and crises.

AB  - Abstract Pulsing hydrology is a major factor affecting fish communities in tropical river‐floodplain ecosystems. Species responses to flow alteration are however poorly understood and are thus difficult to predict. Here, we investigated temporal changes in fish community structure (taxonomic and functional) in the Tonle Sap Lake, a floodplain ecosystem in Cambodia that supports the world largest inland fisheries and a UNESCO biosphere reserve. Fish catches were monitored daily at five locations around the lake between 2012 and 2015, with 53 species obtained over the course of the field study. Nine fish traits were recorded and used to characterize the functional composition of fish communities. Temporal changes in functional community structure in response to hydrological variation were assessed using multiple co‐inertia analysis (MCOA) and cross‐correlation function (CCF) approaches. Analyses revealed an abrupt shift in functional structure following extreme flood events in 2013 that included a marked decrease in large‐bodied fish at high trophic levels. Also observed were seasonal changes in the relative abundance of life‐history strategies, feeding habits, and accessory respiratory adaptations. Black fish (species that are relatively sedentary with an equilibrium‐type life‐history strategy) dominated during low‐water periods, whereas white fish (migratory species with opportunistic or periodic life‐history strategies) were dominant during high‐water periods. Dynamics of local assemblage structure were fairly synchronous spatially and were independent of the distance between locations. Species responses to the peak flood pulse were estimated to lag 1–2 months. Findings from this study indicate that management of fisheries resources in the Tonle Sap Lake should consider differential responses of species to hydrology as a function of life‐history strategies and other functional traits as well as factors that may influence time lags in population and community changes to extreme flow events.

AB  - Seawater-groundwater interactions can enhance the migration process of microplastics to coastal aquifers, posing increased associated environmental risks. Here, we aim to analyze the relationship between seawater intrusion (SWI) and groundwater microplastic pollution in Laizhou Bay (LZB), which is a typical area of sea-land interactions. The results showed that modern seawater intrusion was the main process controlling the migration of microplastics. The detected microplastics in the study area showed a migration pattern from nearshore marine areas to groundwater aquifers along the SWI direction. In addition, the microplastics also reached the brine formed by palaeo-saltwater intrusion through hydraulic exchange between aquifers. By comparing the spatial distributions of different microplastic parameters, we found that nearshore fisheries, commercial, tourism, textile, and agricultural activities were the main sources of microplastics in groundwater in the study area. A risk assessment model of microplastics associated with SWI was further optimized in this study using a three-level classification system by assigning appropriate weights to different potential influencing factors. The results showed moderate comprehensive ecological risks associated with microplastics from seawater intrusion in the study area, with high microplastic enrichment risks. This study provides a scientific basis for future research on seawater-groundwater interactions and microplastic pollution in coastal regions.

AB  - Against the backdrop of evolving global climate patterns, the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events have increased significantly, posing unprecedented threats to agricultural production. This change has particularly profound impacts on agricultural systems in developing countries, making the enhancement of farmers’ capacity to withstand extreme weather events a crucial component for achieving sustainable agricultural development. As an essential safeguard for agricultural production, agricultural insurance plays an indispensable role in risk management. However, a pronounced gap persists between policy aspirations and actual adoption rates among farmers in developing economies. This study employs the integrated theory of planned behavior (TPB) and protection motivation theory (PMT) to construct an analytical framework incorporating psychological, socio-cultural, and risk-perception factors. Using Jiangsu Province—a representative high-risk agricultural region in China—as a case study, we administered 608 structured questionnaires to farmers. Structural equation modeling was applied to identify determinants influencing insurance adoption decisions. The findings reveal that farmers’ agricultural insurance purchase decisions are influenced by multiple factors. At the individual level, risk perception promotes purchase intention by activating protection motivation, while cost–benefit assessment enables farmers to make rational evaluations. At the social level, subjective norms can significantly enhance farmers’ purchase intention. Further analysis indicates that perceived severity indirectly enhances purchase intention by positively influencing attitude, while response costs negatively affect purchase intention by weakening perceived behavior control. Although challenges such as cognitive gaps and product mismatch exist in the intention-behavior transition, institutional trust can effectively mitigate these issues. It not only strengthens the positive impact of psychological factors on purchase intention, but also significantly facilitates the transformation of purchase intention into actual behavior. To promote targeted policy interventions for agricultural insurance, we propose corresponding policy recommendations from the perspective of public intervention based on the research findings.

AB  - Being a country in the Himalayas, Bhutan is highly prone to the vagaries of weather events that affect agricultural production and the subsequent livelihood of the people. To identify the main issues that affect crop production and the decisions of farmers, a survey was conducted in three different agro-ecosystems in Bhutan. Our key findings indicate that farming and the decisions of farmers were largely affected by different climatic and non-climatic factors. These were in descending order of importance: irrigation availability > farm labour > crop seasonality > crop damage (climatic) > land holding > crop damage (wildlife) > crop damage (diseases and pests). The most important consequences of climate change impacts were the drying of irrigation sources (4.35) and crop losses due to weather events (4.10), whereas land fallowing, the occurrence of flood and soil erosion, weed pressure and changes in cropping pattern (with mean ratings of 2.53–3.03) experienced lesser consequences. The extreme weather events, such as untimely rains, drought and windstorms, were rated as the ‘most common’ to ‘common’ occurrences, thus inflicting a crop loss of 1–19%. These confirm our hearsay knowledge that extreme weather events have major consequences on irrigation water, which is said to be either drying or getting smaller in comparison to the past. Therefore, Bhutan must step up its on-ground farmer-support system towards improving the country’s food production, whilst embracing climate smart farm technologies for adapting to the impacts of change.

AB  - Climate change has caused several significant risks to agro-economy in developing regions. Adaptations to climate change can improve farmers’ resilience in agricultural production. Several studies revealed that farmers’ adaptations are not based purely on farmers’ individual competencies. This study attempts to contribute to the existing literature by exploring the relationship between social capital and farmers’ climate change adaptations (CCA). We specified social capital into two components including social networks and training participation. Based on the primary data collected from 422 banana farmers in Southern China, poisson endogenous treatment effect model (PET) was used to estimate the effect of social capital on farmers’ adoption intensity of CCA and examine the determinants of farmers’ participation in social capital. The results reveal that social capital through both components significantly increased farmers’ adoption intensity of CCA, highlighting the importance of social capital to boost farmers’ intensity adoption of CCA in rural areas. Furthermore, education, political participation, land fertility, membership in farmer-based organizations, and income were significant incentives influencing farmers’ participation in social capital. Policymakers are suggested to better understand farmers’ adaptation decisions under weather variability and consider social capital in promoting adaptation strategies to enhance farmers’ resilience in farming activities under climate change.

AB  - Extreme weather events are common in tropical coastal areas and have a significant impact on the livelihoods of livestock farming families. This study aimed to analyze the threats and risks posed by extreme weather events to the livelihoods of dual-purpose cattle farming families in the Costa Chica region of Guerrero state. Data on assets, risk perception, and the impacts of climate threats were collected from 189 cattle production units. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, analysis of variance, cluster analysis, and simple correspondence analysis with the SAS® statistical package. Six livelihoods were identified, with livestock-crop integration (48.7%), livestock-only integration (15.3%), and livestock-crop integration-services integration (12.7%) being the most prevalent. Based on asset and income levels, the livestock-crop integration-trade livelihood had the highest average values, followed by livestock-crop integration and livestock-only integration. Climate risk perception was high, with drought being the most significant risk. Livelihoods with income from services and trade were the least vulnerable to climate threats, as they do not depend entirely on agricultural activities; contrary to what happened with the livestock-only livelihood, which depends on natural resources and was impacted by hurricanes, floods, droughts and high temperatures.

AB  - Poverty, drought, and hunger devastate people on Africa’s rangelands. We used an action-oriented approach from 2000 to 2004 to build capacity among thousands of pastoralists to diversify livelihoods, improve living standards, and enhance livestock marketing. The process included collective action, microfinance, and participatory education. Poor women previously burdened by domestic chores became leaders and rapidly changed their communities. Drought occurred from 2005 to 2008. We assessed intervention effects on household drought resilience with a quasiexperimental format that incorporated survey-based comparisons of treatment groups with ex post controls. Interventions led to major improvements in trends for quality of life, wealth accumulation, hunger reduction, and risk management. Human capacity building can be a driver for change, generating hope and aspirations that set the stage for the use of new information and technology.

AB  - Issues around bundling of climate smart agriculture (CSA) and climate information services (CIS) have been kept relatively distinct whereas in reality, they are more impactful when integrated. Using the case of the Accelerating Impacts of CGIAR Climate Change Research in Africa (AICCRA) Project that emphasizes bundling as a critical component of research in development, six regions of Ghana were purposively selected based on the identified value chain crops for implementation. 120 respondents including practicing farmers and advisors as reference, rated contributions of 21 innovations to 25 climate smartness indicators. These include gender, youth and social inclusion (GSI), enabling environment (EE), ability to enhance soil, water, crop and animal health (One-Health Achievement) (OHA), end-user friendliness (EUF) and climate smart agriculture (CS) for prioritization, bundling and ultimately to construct a Climate Smart Readiness Index (CSRI). There was a high level of concordance between the ratings of farmers and advisors on the Climate Smartness; moderate concordance on OHA and a lower concordance on GSI. The CS and EUF had a significant and same agreement among farmers while EE had a substantial same agreement among advisors. These elements (CS, GSI, OHA, EUF, EE) formed an integral part of the CSRI construct confirmed by the Fornell-Larcker and the Heterotrait-Monotrait criteria. While OHA was the fundamental factor in determining CSRI for farmers, EE was considered more important by the advisors. CSRI informs policy makers and agricultural practitioners on appropriate bundling of CSA and CIS practices to generate evidence for farmer preparedness in the context of resilience, productivity, adaptation, and mitigation.

AB  - The Mekong River is a vital fisheries resource supporting millions of people in mainland Southeast Asia. However, numerous threats have the potential to negatively impact fish populations in this region including overfishing, pollution, climate change and increased urban, agriculture and upstream hydropower development. Although a few studies have examined the population genetic structure of fishes within the upper Mekong River, no known studies have explored that of fishes within the Mekong Delta (MD). Here, we examine the population structure of an important food fish within the MD, Polynemus melanochir, using a panel of 1735 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) generated by restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing across eight locations on the Tien (Mekong) and Hau (Bassac) Rivers in Vietnam. Pairwise FST values, principal component analysis and Structure analysis all indicate high levels of gene flow among the sites sampled across the MD. In contrast to the lack of genetic structure, high levels of relatedness were found, including 26 putatively related pairs, as well as an effective population size (Ne) of less than 500 across the MD. While panmixia indicates that fragmentation of this population is not presently an important threat, a low Ne estimate suggests this species may not be resilient to long-term environmental changes in the MD. The reliance on P. melanochir as a food resource may be contingent on management and mitigation of low effective population sizes.

AB  - The peripheral villages of the Indian Sundarban demonstrate considerable vulnerability to the impacts of climate change. This study assesses present socioeconomic vulnerability and resilience of rural livelihoods to climate change at the local level. Alongside verifies these parameters with an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) prediction model in selected villages in the Gosaba and Hingalganj CD Block, located on the fringes of the Sundarban Mangrove Forest (SMF).This study also aims to assess socio-economic vulnerability and climate resilience nexus. The current study employed a comprehensive vulnerability framework, evaluating exposure, adaptive capacity, and sensitivity index by weighting the initial eigenvalues of each indicator based on their variance percentage via Principal components analysis (PCA). Household resilience index (HRI) was determined by assessing the Social and Physical Resilience (SPR), Environmental Resilience(ER), Socioeconomic Resilience (SER).Selected villages of Gosaba CD Block are relatively highly vulnerable, however the performance of HRI is comparatively better. Sampled villages of Hingalganj CD Block demonstrate moderate vulnerability while possessing relatively low to moderate resilience.In order to mobilize and actively engage local communities, it will be crucial to develop Climate Resilient Villages (CRVs) and establish institutional mechanisms at the village level, such as farmers’ cooperative societies, self-help groups, climate risk management committees.In formulating national disaster management, social welfare, or resource management strategies, it is imperative to devise specific action plans for the designated localities. The national government must facilitate efficient decentralization of governance, allowing local governments to achieve certain objectives.

AB  - The per capita fish consumption in the Philippines has not significantly changed through the years (1987–2003), but the increase in human population has created an ever-increasing demand for food fish. The Philippine Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources has responded to the food fish shortage by promoting mariculture. We support this policy within a comprehensive planning and management framework that includes siting and density of mariculture facilities. The case of Bolinao-Anda, Pangasinan is presented in this article to highlight the multi-faceted process for a successful mariculture enterprise. We use remote sensing tools to track the responses of stakeholder groups to various local legislation, mariculture-induced disasters, and scientific recommendations. Using hydrodynamic models, we assess these responses and highlight potential adjustments that may alleviate the pressure on and maintain the ecosystem health of the Bolinao-Anda coastal waters.

AB  - Dual-purpose sorghum for both grain and bio-ethanol would be preferred to maize and sugarcane for energy production amid concerns for food insecurity and drought in southern Africa. Currently, such varieties are not available and stakeholder requirements have not been determined. Therefore, the views of stakeholders from the smallholder farming sector, industry and the academia were solicited as a first step towards setting the agenda for breeding dual purpose cultivars. Both formal and informal surveys were conducted in marginal areas in Zimbabwe, while the non-farmer stakeholders were interviewed in Zimbabwe and South Africa. It was derived that small-scale farmers have limited knowledge of bio-ethanol production, especially from sorghum stalks. However, the non-farmer stakeholders were aware and largely optimistic of the technology, an observation attributable to better access to information and experience from the sugarcane industry. All stakeholders acknowledged the potential benefits of dual-purpose sorghums in marginal environments with farmers willing to adopt them, and with encouraging views from the other stakeholders, that current sugarcane processing plants can be adjusted to handle sorghum stalks. Nonetheless, it was also perceived that adequate production could be hampered by seasonal supply of stalks because sorghum is a summer crop, and low grain productivity of current varieties ranging between 0.5 and 1.3 t ha-1. This is further compounded by unavailability of farmers’-preferred cultivars. The study indicated that, among other traits, farmers’“ideal” variety should combine high grain yield potential with early to intermediate maturity and high stem sugar content. Unfortunately, these traits are believed to be negatively correlated or mutually exclusive such that improvement of one trait would compromise another. In addition to challenges of product design, improvement of rural infrastructure and access to capital by farmers is crucial for effective exploitation of dual purpose sorghum varieties to provide sufficient food and bio-energy. Above all, stakeholders concurred that successful implementation of the dual purpose sorghum technology would impact positively on food security, environment and rural economies.

AB  - Rice is one of the major staple foods in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and is mainly grown in three environments: rainfed upland and rainfed and irrigated lowlands. In all rice-growing environments, the yield gap (the difference between the potential yield in irrigated lowland or water-limited yield in rainfed lowland and upland and the actual yield obtained by farmers) is largely due to a wide range of constraints including water-related issues. This paper aims to review water management research for rice cultivation in SSA. Major water-related constraints to rice production include drought, flooding, iron toxicity, and soil salinity. A wide range of technologies has been tested by Africa Rice Center (AfricaRice) and its partners for their potential to address some of the water-related challenges across SSA. In the irrigated lowlands, the system of rice intensification and alternate wetting and drying significantly reduced water use, while the pre-conditions to maintain grain yield and quality compared to continuous flooding were identified. Salinity problems caused by the standing water layer could be addressed by flushing and leaching. In the rainfed lowlands, water control structures, Sawah rice production system, and the Smart-Valleys approach for land and water development improved water availability and grain yield compared to traditional water management practices. In the rainfed uplands, supplemental irrigation, mulching, and conservation agriculture mitigated the effects of drought on rice yield. The Participatory Learning and Action Research (PLAR) approach was developed to work with and educate communities to help them implement improved water management technologies. Most of the research assessed a few indicators such as rice yield, water use, water productivity at the field level. There has been limited research on the cost-benefit of water management technologies, enabling conditions and business models for their large-scale adoption, as well as their impact on farmers’ livelihoods, particularly on women and youth. Besides, limited research has been conducted on water management design for crop diversification, landscape-level water management, and iron toxicity mitigation, particularly in lowlands. Filling these research gaps could contribute to sustainable water resources management and sustainable intensification of rice-based systems in SSA.

AB  - The traditionally rich agroforestry systems are usually sustained on the basis of choice, need and importance of the plants. The traditional home gardens are usually the manifestation of indigenous communities long acquired understanding of and commitment to resource conservation based on their custom, religious beliefs and practices. The present study aims to assess plant species diversity and understand the key factors that affect the plant diversity of home garden agroforestry systems of three dominant ethnic communities viz. Bodo, Mishing and Sonowal Kachari residing in the unique floodplain system of Brahmaputra valley region of Assam, Northeast India. A total of 368 plant species were recorded with herbs being the most abundant (159 species) followed by trees (148 species) and shrubs (63 species). With 294 plant species, the Sonowal Kachari home gardens contributed to highest species richness, followed by Mishing (244 species) and Bodo tribe (214 species). Sorenson similarity index revealed high similarity in plant species composition between the Mishing and Sonowal Kachari home gardens. Because of its huge economic and cultural significance, Areca catechu L. was the predominant tree crop in all the ethnic group home gardens. Factors like home garden size and proximity of gardens to major roadways showed significant positive correlation with plant species richness and diversity, while duration of flood and ethnicity had a negative correlation with the same. The owner’s choice had a bearing on the plant species composition of the gardens on a smaller scale, however it was also affected by socio-economic and environmental factors on a broad scale. The information generated from the present study will help to develop a better understanding of the traditional agroforestry systems, preferences of the ethnic communities and development of home gardens towards achieving the greater goal of sustainable livelihood, while contributing to biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Economic ideas and processes are becoming increasingly integrated with more traditional engineering and hydrologic models of water management problems. Combining economic management concepts and performance indicators with an engineering-level of understanding of a hydrologic system can provide results and insights more directly relevant for water management decisions and policies. This research presents a mathematical model of the Ait Ben Yacoub Region (Morocco), elaborated for the first time, to assess potential effects of climate change on irrigated agriculture and resources water. The novelty of the approach lies in the capacity of this integrated framework to take into consideration agronomic, socio-economic and hydrologic systems in a spatially-explicit manner covering all dimensions and scales relevant to climate change. This model simulates the behavior of farmers in response to a severe climate change scenario A2 up to 2050 (IPCC). The results of simulation show that climate change may will reduce considerably the availability of water resources and will reduce also crop yields (between 2% and 10%) and increase irrigation water requirements. The resulting changes of water stress, crop yields and crop competitiveness will drive changes of crop land allocations. The cultivated area will decrease significantly by 45%. The model results demonstrate also that climate change will produce significant reductions of the region’s income by 13% and the small farms will be more vulnerable to this reduction in income. The model and the results constitutes a real tool for preparing actions and strategies to reduce the potential negative impacts of climate change that can be taken by decision makers in the region and nationality.

AB  - Unsustainable groundwater extraction practices have led to a sharp deterioration of the water table, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. In Morocco, the government has implemented certain preventive measures, including Participatory Groundwater Management Contracts (PGMCs). This study aims to enhance our understanding of farmers’ decision-making in the context of participatory groundwater management. To this end, semi-structured interviews were conducted with certain farmers in the Haouz-Mejjate aquifer. This study adopts a qualitative approach to shed light on the common challenges faced by farmers, notably water scarcity and climate change. The novelty of this study lies in assessing the effectiveness of PGMCs in North Africa. Most important, we provide new insights regarding the factors that seem to influence farmers' perspectives and behaviors. Another novelty lies in applying the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) framework to the analysis of perspective of farmers, enabling an improved understanding of the barriers to farmers collaboration with PGMCs. The results highlight the importance of tackling these common challenges, including weak enforcement, insufficient data and information, and limited stakeholder engagement. Moreover, our findings suggest that the limited involvement of farmers in the design and implementation of PGMCs reflects a top-down governance model that undermines both trust in institutions and the effectiveness of PGMCs. Finally, our results underscore the need for targeted interventions to inform farmers clearly, give voice to them, and take into account their various perspectives as a first step to developing effective and agreeable solutions and to improving participatory groundwater governance.

AB  - The capacity of agricultural production in Thailand can be significantly improved by strengthening farmers’ skills. This article aims to present the factors influencing the acceptance and use of the Internet of Things (IoT) among 120 Thai farmers who voluntarily participated in workshops organized by the Community Organizations Development Institute (CODI) across 10 target areas. Primary data were collected through questionnaires and in-depth group interviews, and analyzed using descriptive statistics and multiple regression analysis. The results reveal that extreme weather conditions, rising production costs, and declining product quality have become major challenges in the development of IoT-driven smart farming models. As a result, many farmers are now shifting their mindsets and actively seeking new opportunities to overcome existing and emerging challenges. A promising solution is the context-specific adoption of IoT technologies, tailored to local socio-agricultural conditions. This approach not only addresses current issues but also enhances farmers’ survival strategies and skill development. Two key groups have emerged in this process: farmers proficient in IoT and those using IoT-based systems. The study finds that the most influential factors driving IoT adoption among both groups include (1) efforts to raise plant-based production standards (2) reduction in production cost-related risks, and (3) supportive government policies promoting IoT use in agriculture-all with statistical significance at the 0.05 level.

AB  - Abstract Ecological connectivity is one of the most important processes that shape marine populations and ecosystems, determining their distribution, persistence, and productivity. Here we use the synergy of Lagrangian back-trajectories, otolith-derived ages of larvae, and satellite-based chlorophyll-a to identify spawning areas of European anchovy from ichthyoplanktonic data, collected in the Strait of Sicily (Central Mediterranean Sea), i.e., the crucial channel in between the European and African continents. We obtain new evidence of ecosystem connectivity between North Africa and recruitment regions off the southern European coasts. We assess this result by using bio-energetic modeling, which predicts species-specific responses to environmental changes by producing quantitative information on functional traits. Our work gives support to a collaborative and harmonized use of Geographical Sub-Areas, currently identified by the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean. It also confirms the need to incorporate climate and environmental variability effects into future marine resources management plans, strategies, and directives.

AB  - In October 2003, an artificial canal was dug across the Langue de Barbarie sand spit at the mouth of the Senegal River to prevent the city of Saint-Louis (Senegal) from being submerged by floods. This study aimed to explore the multiple facets of this sudden environmental change to provide a holistic overview of the situation and a better understanding of man-made alterations of coastal features, a crucial step for implementing efficient management of such situations and developing appropriate mitigation and adaptation policies. Satellite imagery from the US Geological Survey was used to show the historical evolution of the breach, and a comprehensive overview of the existing literature was conducted to explore its hydrological, geomorphological, ecological, and socioeconomic impacts. Although the canal facilitated the rapid evacuation of floodwaters and saved the city from a major flooding event, the breach widened considerably, becoming the new river mouth and resulted in unforeseen adverse consequences. Environmental consequences included the partial dismantling of the spit, increased tidal range, salinization of land and water, and loss of habitat and local biodiversity. Socioeconomic consequences were severe, including the loss of agricultural land and reduced yields, declining fishing productivity, the destruction of villages, the displacement of entire communities, and the forced migration of many young people. Affected communities developed resilience strategies, with women playing a leading role in these adaptive responses. This study highlights the need for integrated coastal management and policies that consider both environmental and human factors, as well as for future research that will help improve the management of coastal ecosystem alterations.

AB  - Farming is the main economic activity in the West African savannah. It is, however, characterized by high variability. The situation is fueled by poor soil fertility, uncertain water availability, limited infrastructure and persistent institutional weakness. The effects of climate change, which are particularly acute in the region, have exacerbated the situation. As an initiative aiming to enhance the scientific knowledge in the region, the West African Science Service on Climate Change and Adapted Land Use (WASCAL) was established. This chapter summarizes the examples of the WASCAL research on farmer climate change adaptation carried out during the last six years. It offers combined disciplinary and interdisciplinary insights on how farmers respond to climate change and its impacts, revealing the feasibility of the assessed measures and the pre-conditions that these should fulfill to perform successfully. Two catchments/political units across the Sudan savannah belt were studied, i.e., the Dassari arrondissement in north-western Benin and the Dano department in south-western Burkina Faso. The ecological similarities and institutional and political differences were contrasted and discussed. After crosschecking the farmer perceptions on climate change with their preferred farming adaptation measures, some of them were analyzed in depth. These indicate no causality between climate records, experienced hazards and household harm. Declines in yields and also pest outbreaks, although accurately estimated, do not relate to climate change only. Similarly, farming coping measures are widespread and not exclusively climate related, and appear to prioritize food security, inflow of cash and household overall capitalization in this order. The assessed coping measures strengthen rural households’ resilience, albeit differently. In contrast, largely approved measures such as switching to resistant species and varieties or exploitation of the effects of residual fertilization did not withstand field validation. In this context, key for feasible farming climate change coping measures is the provision of short-term economic benefits matching the local socio-ecological conditions and harmonizing with ongoing traditional practices. Furthermore, key actors for operationalization are the agricultural extension institutions. © 2020 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - During the water crisis of 2015–2016, the construction of small earth-filled dams grew to supply irrigated crops of the north of Espírito Santo-ES, Brazil. This paper reports the hydrogeochemical study of eight reservoirs conducted between 10/2016 to 11/2017 to assess the water suitability for agricultural purposes and its risk to irrigation systems. The reservoirs of São Mateus (SM) are located in large drainage basins with many impoundments upstream. Nova Venecia's reservoirs (NV) have small and circular drainage areas with few, or any, upstream dams. The results are consistent with freshwater classification and Na-Cl composition to all reservoirs. Nevertheless, canonical discriminant analysis and Spearman's coefficients revealed distinct composition and patterns of correlations between municipalities. The mean permeability index of 53 and the low risk of sodicity and salinization (C1S1) demonstrate that these waters' use is harmless to the soil and crops. However, the phosphate contents make the new reservoirs susceptible to algae blooms. The same reservoirs also presented total solids and Fe levels above the tolerable limit for safety irrigation use, imposing a severe risk of clogging. The low replenishment of SM's reservoirs reflects the dispute over water resulting from the high number of impoundments in these drainage areas. The drought that preceded the study diminished the drainage basins' vegetation cover, favoring soil particles' runoff, elevating the TS and Fe levels, especially in the recently built reservoirs. Farmers must control soil erosion to avoid water quality compromise, to reduce the risk of failure and the irrigation system's maintenance cost.

AB  - Global changes and society’s development necessitate the improvement of water use and irrigation water saving, which require a set of water management measures to best deal with the necessary changes. This study considers the framework of the change process for water management in the Hetao Irrigation District (HID) of the Yellow River Basin. This paper presents the main measures that have been applied to ensure the sustainability and modernization of Hetao, mitigating water scarcity while maintaining land productivity and environmental value. Several components of modernization projects that have already been implemented are characterized, such as the off-farm canal distribution system, the on-farm surface irrigation, innovative crop and soil management techniques, drainage, and salinity control, including the management of autumn irrigation and advances of drip irrigation at the sector and farm levels. This characterization includes technologies, farmer training, labor needs, energy consumption, water savings, and economic aspects, based on data observed and reported in official reports. Therefore, this study integrates knowledge and analyzes the most limiting aspects in some case studies, evaluating the effectiveness of the solutions used.

AB  - Abstract Winter chill accumulation plays a crucial role in determining the moment of bud burst in temperate fruit and nut trees, and insufficient chill can greatly limit yield potentials. To assess future cultivation options for such species in South America, we estimated winter chill through a spatial analysis. We used historical data (1980–2017) from 158 weather stations to calibrate a weather generator and produce temperature data for 10 historical and 60 future scenarios. We computed Safe Winter Chill (SWC, corresponding to the 10th quantile of a chill distribution) for the period 1980–2017 and for all historical and future weather scenarios and developed a framework to interpolate SWC for the continent using the Kriging method. To improve the interpolation, we applied a 3D correction model based on two co-variables (means of daily temperature extremes in July). Our results suggest important chill declines in southern Brazil and central Chile. By 2050 under the global warming scenario RCP4.5 (Representative Concentration Pathway), absolute SWC in these regions may reach a median of 18.7 and 39.6 Chill Portions (CP), respectively. Projections are most alarming for a strong global warming scenario (RCP8.5). In southern South America, adequate SWC levels of about 60 CP may be expected even under the RCP8.5 scenario. Our results highlight the need for climate change adaptation measures to secure temperate fruit production in important growing regions of South America. The procedure we developed may help farmers and practitioners across South America estimate future SWC to adapt their orchards to future challenges.

AB  - Many rural communities in Cameroon rely on natural sources of water (rivers, springs, and rainfall) for agriculture and domestic use. Access to and reliability of water from these sources depend on changes in rainfall and temperatures. Household roles in Cameroon are traditionally defined along gender lines, with women playing key roles in food production, home management, and caregiving. Water is indispensable for women to successfully accomplish these roles. Climate variability is affecting reliability of water in Cameroon; however, impacts are not the same for men and women in rural communities. This paper examines how climate-induced water challenges adversely affect women’s ability to perform their multiple roles in a predominantly farming community in southwest Cameroon. Data collected by survey from a hundred women, supplemented by interviews with local water and agricultural technicians, suggest that climate change has contributed to the disappearance of several water sources and decreased volume of others. This hampers local water availability, compromises women’s productivity, and increases the burden on women’s triple roles as farmers, caregivers, and home managers. Although individual women are implementing some adaptation strategies, comprehensive public policy measures, including promotion of better land use management and gender-sensitive technologies, are vital to sustain efforts against climate change in Cameroon.

AB  - One of the greatest challenges in grain yield modeling, in the context of operational crop estimates for large areas, is related to identifying the periods in which annual crops are most susceptible to environmental stresses. For soybean cultivation, grown in the spring-summer period in southern Brazil, the main risk factor is the occurrence of water stress during flowering and grain filling. These sub-periods occur at different times throughout the production region as a consequence of different management practices by producers. This work aimed to relate the soybean crop calendar to temporal profiles of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI/MODIS), in order to present/validate a low-cost technology with adequate accuracy for crop monitoring and forecasting. To this end, agricultural calendar data (flowering, grain filling, and maturation sub-periods) for soybean cultivation in EMATER (RS) regional offices and NDVI images from the MODIS sensor were analyzed. The results showed that NDVI temporal profiles allow monitoring the temporal evolution of soybean crop biomass and determining the occurrence of sub-periods of the cycle. The differences in NDVI value between harvests, regions, and sub-periods of the crop cycle demonstrate the sensitivity of this index in detecting the responses of soybean plants to environmental conditions. As a consequence of the NDVI data being generated from MODIS images, it is possible to spatially represent information about the sub-periods for all harvests and throughout the state, allowing for greater temporal and spatial detail compared to the current availability of data.

AB  - Abstract Indigenous People and Local Communities (IPLC) can play an important role in reforestation for climate change mitigation while providing environmental and livelihood benefits. However, there is a lack of direct comparison between different reforestation design's carbon uptake potential and their relevance to community reforestation. We evaluate the carbon capture and survival of the four most common reforestation designs in a 14‐year‐long project in an Emberá community in eastern Panama. We look at native timber mixtures and monocultures, agroforestry, and natural regrowth with enrichment planting. To explain the differences between plots, we compare design, management and environmental characteristics using redundancy analyses (RDA). We then contextualize our results with the project leader's perspectives of success using interviews and workshops. In the first decade, mixtures and monocultures of timber stored on average roughly 3× more carbon than agroforestry and enrichment planting (140 tCO 2 /ha compared to 40 tCO 2 /ha and 53 tCO 2 /ha). The project design had the largest influence on carbon storage and survival with an explanatory power of 31% followed by management and environmental characteristics (14% and 2% respectively). The largest threat to the survival and growth was the risk of fire which caused mortality in more than 2/3 of the plots. Some damage was offset by natural regrowth which accounted for 34% of the total carbon, but the participants generally perceived natural regrowth as being “dirty.” They had a strong preference for agroforestry, particularly coffee ( Coffea spp.), a crop with negligible carbon value, but high economic value. ‘Practical implication’ : The findings underscore the need to balance carbon sequestration with local economic preferences, integrate community input, mitigate environmental risks and adopt long‐term, holistic approaches for effective reforestation projects.

AB  - The study of the variation and development trend of regional oceanographic parameters is of great significance to the prevention and mitigation of disasters, the development and utilization of oceans, the guidance of human activities at sea, and the monitoring of the El Niño phenomenon. As an important fishery in China, the changes in oceanographic parameters have severely affected the development of the Zhoushan Islands. The spatial–temporal pattern evolution of oceanographic parameters and the response of oceanographic parameters and El Niño in the Zhoushan sea area are analyzed in this study. The remote sensing datasets of sea surface salinity (SSS), sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface height (SSH), and chlorophyll concentration (Chl) in the Zhoushan sea area were collected and averaged spatially, temporally, and yearly, in order to analyze the variability monthly and yearly, and during El Niño. The results are as follows: (1) SSS is smallest near the shore and increases with distance offshore; SST has obvious seasonal variation; the maximum variation of SSH occurred in the coastal area; and a high-value zone of Chl arises during spring and summer. (2) In the recent twenty years, SSS increased at a rate of 0.1241 PSU per year. SST, SSH, and Chl decrease at 0.0294 °C per year, 0.14 cm per year, and 0.0853 mg/m3 per year, respectively. (3) Different types of El Niños have different effects on oceanographic parameters.

AB  - Abstract Climate change is expected to exacerbate damage to agricultural production from natural disasters. Examination of measures to adapt to the damage represents an urgent matter for agriculture. A multidisciplinary research project aimed at providing effective information related to development a weather index insurance (WII) system was conducted for rice farmers in a coastal region of Myanmar to achieve sustainable rice farm management in the country, which is among the world’s poorest and most disaster prone. For lower income countries, WII is one adaptation measure to mitigate damage by climate change. Using remote sensing and statistical data, changes in tracks of cyclones in the Bay of Bengal, the duration of damage by cyclone disasters, and areas affected by saltwater intrusion were analyzed to ascertain risk levels for disasters in the target area: Labutta township in the Ayeyarwady region. Furthermore, demand analysis of WII using discrete choice experiments, a question-based statistical survey method, revealed that farmers’ demand of WIIs for cyclone landfall, flood, and drought is relatively greater than that for saltwater intrusion. This finding indicates that saltwater intrusion might not be a crucially important matter for farmers who cultivate rainfed rice, whereas inland water floods caused by cyclone landfall and drought caused for changing the weather patterns represent a threat for these farmers. Results of econometric model analysis for designing a WII indicate that if a regular farmer in the township were to pay 41.5 US dollars per year to purchase WII for flood damage, their expected income will be stable.

AB  - Pakistan faces significant future challenges to feed a growing population, with 47 % of the populace currently categorised as food insecure and water becoming scarcer. The current rice-wheat (RW) cropping system is critical for food security, but exhibits low productivity due to sub-optimal varieties, timings, and nitrogen (N) stress. We investigated farmer management strategies to increase the productivity of the RW system while quantifying trade-offs with environmental sustainability (particularly nitrate leaching). Cropping systems simulation with a validated model (APSIM) enabled analysis of a broad range of current management practice modifications (crop sowing dates, varieties, fertiliser rates, and deficit irrigation strategies) in a large Monte-Carlo Matrix (13,000+ elements). We evaluated annual crop production, gross margins (GMs), irrigated water productivity (WPi), nitrate leaching, ET and the crop transpiration proportion of total ET, for all combinations on an annual basis over a 35-year simulation period (1980−2014). We found that WPi in both the highest (Gujranwala) and lowest yielding (Narowal) districts of Punjab can be maximised by using a shorter-season rice cultivar sown slightly later than current farmer practice and irrigated under alternate wetting-and-drying (AWD – with 2–4 days gap), with increased N fertiliser. The currently-used wheat variety was found to be satisfactory and capable of capitalising on the earlier sowing possible through timelier rice harvest, yet with a more generous wheat irrigation strategy (4−5 irrigations rather than 3−4) and N fertiliser regime. The currently-used long-season rice variety maximises GM at Gujranwala, largely due to premium grain prices for that variety, however in this water-limited cropping environment maximising WPi will maximise regional production. If no N-leaching limits apply, system WPi at Gujranwala can be increased by a factor of 2.67x over current farmer levels, via the indicated management changes, with associated N fertiliser increases of 1.8–2.2 times at Gujranwala. If annual N leaching limits are imposed (50, 100 or 150 kg N ha−1), those achievable WPi gains change to 2.0x, 2.6x, and 2.67x respectively at Gujranwala, with limits on applied N fertiliser being the only changes in optimised agronomic management. A key finding was that even under the strictest N-leaching limit (50 kg N ha−1 yr−1, which is similar to what farmers currently lose), it is still possible to significantly increase system water productivity (by 2.0x) through the optimised agronomic changes, while using less fertiliser N (0.8x). Our research indicates considerable gains in rice and wheat food production are possible for the Pakistani Punjab through farmer management changes, however risks associated with uncertain water supplies need to be assessed.

AB  - Crop diversification can restore land fertility and increase smallholder farmers’ resistance to climate change and market fluctuations, particularly for female farmers who are more vulnerable to the impact of these risks. To understand planting situation, motivation and influencing factors of crop diversification of smallholder farmers based on gender differences, we conducted a detailed survey of 262 smallholder farmers (118 female and 144 male) in the Shaanxi Plain of China. On average, male-headed households planted 2.27 species on 0.47 ha of land, whereas female-headed households planted 1.57 species on 0.37 ha of land. The main factors motivating smallholder farmers to diversify their crops are increased income and reduced economic loss of market fluctuation; the main obstacle is farmer reliance on traditional planting methods. We found significant gender differences following the expanded theory of planned behavior model. Attitude (standardized path coefficient (SPC) = 0.32), subjective norms (SPC = 0.26), perceived behavior control (SPC = 0.32) and environmental knowledge (SPC = 0.27) significantly impact male-headed households’ willingness of crop diversification. In contrast, female-headed households are most significantly influenced by perceived behavior control (SPC = 0.42), followed by attitude (SPC = 0.34) and subjective norms (SPC = 0.21), whereas environmental knowledge has no significant effect on their willingness to diversify their crops. Female-headed households are sensitive to climate change, but their low education, less access to agricultural extension and weak family decision-making power contribute to their unwillingness and inability to reduce risks by adopting crop diversification. Agricultural credit, crop diversification training, and efficient agricultural extension services are recommended for increasing farmer’s adoption of crop diversification and risk alleviation.

AB  - Abstract Purpose Argan oil is sourced from the argan tree’s fruit, predominantly found in rural communities in southwestern Morocco. Women utilize indigenous knowledge to produce argan oil in their homes through a laborious, manual process. Although to meet the growing market demand, cooperatives often use machines for certain production steps. This study explores the social and environmental impacts of different argan oil production processes to evaluate the tradeoffs and opportunities that emerge in this time-honored craft. Methods Cradle-to-gate social and environmental life cycle assessments were performed on six scenarios, comparing traditional (manual), semi-mechanized, and fully mechanized scenarios for cosmetic and edible argan oil production. The stakeholders considered included Workers and the Local Community. Social impact categories of salary, working hours, health and safety, human energy expenditure, and local employment were assessed. Twenty-six households near Sidi Ifni and four cooperatives near Agadir were surveyed in Morocco. Environmental impact categories included global warming potential, ecotoxicity potential, human toxicity, water consumption, and fossil fuel potential. Reference point thresholds were used for the social impact assessment, and ReCiPe 2016 was used for the environmental impact assessment. A sensitivity analysis was conducted on each scenario, evaluating how productive capacity affects the categories of social and environmental impact. Results and discussion The manual production process had the lowest environmental impact. In each scenario, edible argan oil production had a higher environmental impact than its cosmetic equivalent. The scenario analysis revealed that semi-mechanized production typically had greater environmental impacts than fully mechanized production. However, if the semi-mechanized productive capacity is sufficiently higher, then fully mechanized production has the greatest environmental impact. The semi-mechanized productive capacity can be increased by adding more employees. Collection of argan fruit and kneading were reported to be the most challenging steps for manual production by argan oil producers. Collection, depulping, and crushing had the highest human energy expenditures. Women producing argan oil at home earned more daily income than cooperative workers although both earn less than the legal daily minimum wage in Morocco. Conclusion The LCA and S-LCA results show the effectiveness of applying both approaches to analyze production processes. The semi-mechanized production process can increase productive capacity while maintaining employment. However, oversight and transparency are needed to ensure that argan oil producers are compensated fairly. Including health and safety questions as well as human energy calculations demonstrated that while kneading did not have a high amount of human energy expenditure, it was one of the most difficult steps.

AB  - Sustainable horticulture development is a priority area considering climate change, especially in the context of reduced water supply. The search for ways to regulate the resistance of fruit trees to stressors is an urgent issue for the world community. The use of beneficial microorganisms to inoculate plant roots helps reduce the use of synthetic substances and is an alternative for sustainable horticulture. The purpose of the study is to identify the specific features of the effect of root inoculation by mycorrhizal fungi on the reaction of sweet cherries to develop strategies for managing the production of fruit products. The study was conducted during 2018- 2020 in the sweet sweet cherry orchard of the southern steppe subzone of Ukraine. Such research methods as field, laboratory, biochemical, physiological, and statistical were used. The regularities of the influence of mycorrhizal fungi on the total moisture content and water-holding capacity of sweet cherry leaves were examined. In the first year of studies on endomycorrhizal root inoculation, these indicators were higher compared to the control group. The positive effect of endo-ectomycorrhiza on the waterholding capacity of sweet cherry leaves was elucidated. The total leaf surface and the content of green pigments in the leaves were determined as one of the main indicators of the photosynthetic potential of a fruit crop. The effect of inoculation of sweet cherry roots by mycorrhizal fungi on the ratio of chlorophylls (a/b) in leaves was established. The parameters of the content of total nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in sweet cherry leaves were determined. The use of mycorrhizal fungi increases the adaptive properties of sweet cherry trees to stressful factors, namely, arid conditions in the south of Ukraine. The research results can be used by fruit producers to improve climate-optimised technologies, which will substantially reduce risks and possible economic losses, and preserve biodiversity

AB  - Abstract Agroforestry in Nepal is a multifaceted and sustainable approach that harmonizes agricultural, environmental, and socioeconomic goals. This study conducted a comprehensive review of agroforestry systems in Nepal, emphasizing their impact on food security, rural livelihoods, and environmental sustainability. By bridging research gaps and highlighting environmental advantages, it provides valuable insights for evidence‐based policymaking, making it a significant resource for Nepal and beyond. The study employed a comprehensive desktop review methodology using a PRISMA Flow Diagram for data collection and utilized academic databases to include literature related to agroforestry practices, their impacts, and associated socioeconomic and environmental aspects. Agroforestry systems in Nepal offer a comprehensive approach to sustainable agriculture, economic empowerment, and environmental conservation while enhancing resilience to climate change. While these systems provide multiple benefits, including enhanced soil quality and increased carbon sequestration, they also face challenges related to technical knowledge and market access. To fully harness the potential of agroforestry and address food (SDG 2), and energy security, and land degradation, bridging the gap between researchers and farmers, promoting information dissemination, and establishing support mechanisms are essential. Aligning with government strategies and international initiatives can pave the way for a more sustainable and prosperous future for Nepal's rural communities and environment.

AB  - Abstract Schizotetranychus oryzae Rossi de Simons attains pest level in rice crops. This study aimed to evaluate the biological features of Neoseiulus californicus (McGregor) feeding on S. oryzae on leaves of flooded rice. We also evaluated N. californicus behavior in response to S. oryzae and conspecific cues. Thirty-two eggs were individually placed in arenas on rice leaves and fed on S. oryzae for the biological test. Three cultivars were used to test the behavior of N. californicus in response to S. oryzae and conspecific cues. The intrinsic rate of increase (rm) of the predator feeding on S. oryzae was 0.21 female/female/day. Schizotetranychus oryzae was considered a suitable prey for N. californicus under laboratory conditions. The results obtained in behavioral tests showed that N. californicus preferred laying eggs on leaves uninfested by S. oryzae and it did not show oviposition preference in arenas with conspecific predator cues. This predator was found in all rice cultivation areas in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Neoseiulus californicus proved to be a control agent for S. oryzae.

AB  - Adopting early-maturing maize varieties can substantially increase yield and yield stability in suitable environments. Actionable recommendations that specify where early-maturing varieties can be suitably applied are lacking across low-income countries. We found for maize in Malawi that varieties with longer maturity duration provide on average the highest yield. However, if water stress occurs, we found that its timing determines which seed variety performs best. If water stress conditions are confined to the late season, early-maturing varieties escape drought and perform better than medium- and late-maturing varieties. Instead, if water stress conditions start already from mid-season, early-maturing varieties perform worst. Our results demonstrate that the typical seasonal timing of water stress can serve as a suitable criterion for recommending where to adopt early-maturing varieties. Finally, we propose an integrated research framework that complements our econometric analysis and allows to derive actionable variety suitability recommendations at the country level.

AB  - The Shouf Biosphere Reserve (SBR), with a surface of 50,000 ha is located in Mount Lebanon, Lebanon. SBR harbors a rich flora with about 1,100 species, many of them with edible, aromatic and medicinal properties. The landscape includes a mosaic of agro-silvo-pastoral systems, characterized by pastures, forests-including the largest expanse of Cedrus libani forests in Lebanon-and traditional agriculture terraces (olives, fruit trees). Landscape in the SBR is the result of: i) overuse of habitats and wild plant species; ii) inadequate policies on land use planning; iii) rural abandonment resulting in soil erosion, agro-biodiversity loss, and the conversion of agricultural land into chaotic urbanization; iv) agriculture intensification, pollution. Climate change trends in the region are already exacerbating environmental risks (forest fires, water scarcity). Building resilience in the SBR through forest landscape restoration entails interventions to strengthen the adaptive capacity of the social and ecological politics in the region. The project developed protocols for the production and sustainable use of high quality plant material of more than 40 native plant species. An advanced method for monitoring and large scale detailed mapping was used to improve the investigation of terraces. More than 12 ha of degraded terraces were restored and planted with native fruit tree species and shrubs. Sustainable farming in the restored terraces implied combined actions on: i) biodiversity conservation-both the diversification of planted species and cultivars, and the conservation and management of marginal habitats linked to farming system; ii) organic food production; and iii) the management of agriculture waste to reduce environmental risks while generating new revenues.

AB  - Climate change impacts on agriculture have substantial implications on human diet and nutrition. This study explored the factors affecting the adoption decisions of climate-smart agricultural practices through a multivariate probit model and then assessed the average effect of these adopted practices on rural households’ food diversity and per capita dietary intake by using propensity score matching. For this purpose, a total of 196 rural households from the Punjab province were selected through a multi-stage purposive and random sampling procedure for face to face survey. According to research results, the family type was found positively associated with the adoption of all climate-smart agricultural practices. More than 50% of the total daily per capita calorie and iron consumption of rural households is provided by the cereal crops. The Simpson food diversity index indicates that rural households adopting a higher number of practices consume more diversified food as compared to rural households with a lower number of practices at their farm. Moreover, the difference between the per capita calorie intake of full adopters and multiple adopters is the lowest as compared to the difference between full adopters and partial adopters and the difference between full adopters and single adopters. Thus, adopting more climate-smart agricultural practices increase calorie intake more than adopting fewer practices at the farm. Given a positive association between the level of adoption and food diversity as well as nutritional outcomes, government agencies should create awareness among the rural community about the benefits of adopting more climate-smart agricultural practices through visiting fields and organizing regular training for better nutrition.

AB  - Climate change is expected to increase the frequency, intensity and spatial extent of extreme climate events, and thus is a key concern for food production. However, food insecurity is usually analysed under a mean climate change state. Here we combine crop modelling and climate scenarios to estimate the effects of extreme climate events on future food insecurity. Relative to median-level climate change, we find that an additional 20–36% and 11–33% population may face hunger by 2050 under a once-per-100-yr extreme climate event under high and low emission scenarios, respectively. In some affected regions, such as South Asia, the amount of food required to offset such an effect is triple the region’s current food reserves. Better-targeted food reserves and other adaptation measures could help fill the consumption gap in the face of extreme climate variability. The world’s future food security will certainly be affected by extreme climate events, yet the location and magnitude of their impact are often overlooked. Using crop yield and food need projections under different socioeconomic conditions, this study estimates the share of the population at the risk of hunger under high and low greenhouse gas emission scenarios in the face of climate extremes.

AB  - Seagrasses help mitigate climate change by capturing and storing carbon for a very long time. Despite their significance, multiple threats are putting pressure on this valuable habitat. Seagrass conservation and restoration is essential to maintain the carbon sequestration service, along with the other ecosystem services (e.g., fisheries production). Information on the status of seagrass habitat is required to enable proactive management strategies. In this study, we assessed the ecological status of seagrass meadows in Indonesia, a globally significant hotspot of blue carbon habitat, using five resilience parameters: seagrass species richness, seagrass cover, macroalgal cover, epiphyte cover, and water transparency. We collected data on these parameters from 18 locations across Indonesia and developed the Seagrass Ecological Quality Index (SEQI, range 0–1) that summarises the parameters into a standard seagrass assessment. We recorded that Thalassia hemprichii and Enhalus acoroides were the most common species in the sampling locations. Seagrass cover was on average 39 ± 3.6% (mean ± SE) which was lower than measured 3 years before (46%). Macroalgal cover and epiphyte cover were relatively low with mean values 10 ± 1.8% and 22 ± 4.4% respectively. Most locations had clear water. Our analysis showed that Indonesia's seagrass meadows are generally in moderate condition, indicated by the mean value of SEQI 0.68 ± 0.02. These findings provide a baseline for seagrass conservation and management. It enables setting up of specific goals for management action plans, at both the local, national and international level, and where appropriate, track the progress of management actions based on threat mitigation or restoration over time. The SEQI is a useful tool to summarise the condition of tropical seagrass meadows in Indonesia and could be applied across Southeast Asia or the Tropical Indo-Pacific bioregion.

AB  - This study employed data from the 2005/06 Uganda national household survey to identify adaptation strategies and factors governing their choice in Uganda's agricultural production. Factors that mediate or hinder adaptation across different shocks and strategies include age of the household head, access to credit and extension facilities and security of land tenure. There are also differences in choice of adaptation strategies by agro-climatic zone. The appropriate policy level responses should complement the autonomous adaptation strategies by facilitating technology adoption and availing information to farmers not only with regard to climate related forecasts but available weather and pest resistant varieties.

AB  - Although Vietnam's coastal and estuarine areas are most vulnerable to the impact of climate shocks, very few studies have closely evaluated this vulnerability. This research applied the Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI) and the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change vulnerability framework (LVI-IPCC) to estimate the climate vulnerability of small-scale fisheries in the Tam Giang – Cau Hai lagoon, Central Vietnam - recognised as the biggest brackish water lagoon in South East Asia. Mixed methods, including key informant interviews, group discussions and questionnaire surveys (N = 181), were applied to collect empirical data in two estuarine fishery communities of Loc Binh and Huong Phong communes, Thua Thien Hue province. Two important findings emerge from this analysis, (1) the overall results of this study indicate that livelihood strategies and availability of food are the most critical factors in determining livelihood vulnerability for the two surveyed communes in the TG-CH lagoon and (2) the LVI and LVI-IPCC are effective tools to assessing vulnerability at the community level. It is expected that the lessons learnt from this study will assist in designing future studies and help devise intervention strategies to reduce the vulnerability of small-scale fishery communities in developing countries.

AB  - Adapting to climate change is critical to building sustainable and resilient agricultural systems. Understanding farmers' perceptions of climate change has become the key to the effective implementation of climate change adaptation policies. This research draws multidisciplinary attention to how farmers participate in decision-making on adaptation behaviors and provides useful insights for realizing synergies between environmental change and agricultural production. In this work, we conducted a meta-analysis of 63 quantitative studies on Chinese farmers' adaptation to climate change to assess the relationship between motivational factors and adaptation behavior. Our analysis highlights that farmers' perceptions of precipitation changes are often inaccurate; however, other psychological factors, such as perception, experience, and risk attitude, significantly positively impact their adaptation behavior. In addition, different climate regions are the main source of high heterogeneity in inter-study comparisons of climate change perception, and the effect of climate regions may therefore constitute a moderating factor that weakens the positive relationship between climate change perception and adaptive behavior. Furthermore, this study highlights the need to intervene at the household level to enhance farmers' adaptability to climate change, which includes providing support through income diversification, early warning information services, training, assistance, credit, subsidies, and other resources. In the future, research on how perception, experience, and risk interact to affect adaptive behavior should be strengthened.

AB  - Concerns about food security are growing around the world, precipitated by climate change, resource degradation, a growing population and increasing income disparity. In India, food insecurity is high in many rural farming communities, especially among isolated tribal populations. In this study we examine how knowledge about sustainable food production is acquired and mobilized among small-scale farmers belonging to the Malayalis Tribe, who reside in the Kolli Hills region of Tamil Nadu, India. We focus on nutrition gardening and fish farming, two production practices recently introduced to alleviate poverty and malnutrition in the region. Using qualitative participatory research methods, we explored ways in which farmers are accessing, using and sharing knowledge about these practices, and barriers to equitable access. We also asked farmers what information is still lacking about these practices and what mechanisms could be put in place to improve access. This research revealed that participants in both nutrition gardening and fish farming rely primarily on external experts (non-governmental agricultural research and extension) for formal training (e.g. workshops) and advice, despite a long history and traditional knowledge of gardening and river fishing. Agricultural knowledge is also mobilized within the region less formally between individuals and households through face-to-face contact or verbal communication via mobile phones. The use of additional communication technologies (e.g. computers) to enhance access and mobilization of knowledge was perceived to be most relevant and beneficial for young, educated people.

AB  - Agriculture is the major land use across the globe and the agricultural activity has always included adaptation to a number of diverse stresses and opportunities–elements that continue influencing developments in the agriculture sector. Climate change, mainly through increased extremes and temporal/spatial shifts, would worsen food security in some parts of the globe. The impacts of climatic risk on agriculture in Europe and India are manifolds. With the new understanding that climate change is real, happening, and inevitable, the complexities involved in farming have become manifold. In the countries, where the majority’s livelihoods are intertwined with farming pursuits, the challenges in agriculture would seriously threaten livelihoods; push them to face more unpredictable situations. To mitigate the climate change effect on agricultural production and productivity, there is an urgent need for a range of adaptive strategies including improvement in natural resource base, diversifying cropping systems, adapting farming systems approach and strengthening of extension system using biotechnology and information technologies. Integration is a key feature for both practicing and promoting sustainable agriculture and for developing climate risk adaptation policy. Farmers rarely make decisions for their operations without weighing a number of issues, possible outcomes, and desired results. Sensitization of the farming community with the environmental concerns has to be given top priority. Balanced and conjunctive use of biomass, organic and inorganic fertilizers and controlled use of agrochemicals through integrated nutrient management (INM) and integrated pest management (IPM) including resource conservation will have to be promoted to achieve the sustainable increase in agricultural production. Agriculture will need to be progressively adapted to projected climate change and agricultural research systems must be oriented to monitor and evaluate climate change and recommend changes in agricultural practices accordingly duly supported by the convergence and integration of traditional knowledge and practice systems, information technology, geospatial technologies and biotechnology.

AB  - Droughts, short growing seasons and poorly distributed rainfall are major constraints to maize production in eastern semi-arid region of Rwanda. In situ rain water harvesting offers an alternative option to reduce rainwater runoff, increase infiltration and storage of water in soil and reduce the effects of drought stress on maize grain yield. The objective of the study was to assess the effects of in situ water harvesting techniques on soil moisture content, maize growth and grain yield in Nyagatare, Rwanda in the 2011-2012 seasons. The study comprised of four treatments: pot holing, tied-ridging and mulching compared to control treatment of planting on the flat. The experimental design was randomized complete block with three replicates. Soil moisture content and maize plant dry weight were measured at 8, 11 and 14 weeks after emergence (WAE). There was a significant increase (P< 0.001) in soil moisture content and maize plant dry weight from planting on the flat (control), pot hole, tied ridges to mulching at 8, 11 and 14 WAE. Yield components (ear mass, number of grains per ear and 100 grain weight) and grain yield significantly increased (P< 0.001) from planting on the flat, pot holes, tied ridges and were highest in the mulched treatment. Maize grain yield increased (P< 0.001) by 49.6, 103 and 136% of the maize grain yield harvested from the flat planting (1593.36 kg ha-1) in the pot-holing, tied ridging and mulching treatments, respectively. The results of this study indicate that mulching, tied ridges and pot holes, in decreasing order of effectiveness, have potential to increase soil moisture content and reduce the damage caused by drought stress to maize growth and grain yield and therefore recommended for farmers in Nyagatare and other drought prone regions

AB  - Desertification is one of the major challenges human society facing today and it is exacerbated by climate change, and threatens sustenance of human life on the planet. Desertification refers to the process of fertile land transforming into desert, typically as a result of deforestation, drought or improper/inappropriate agriculture. Desertification is a serious problem for the drylands owing to climate change or anthropological reasons affecting the agricultural production and sustainability of ecologies (Geist, 2005). Drylands occupy approximately 40% of Earth’s land area and are home to more than 2 billion people. It has been estimated that nearly 10–20% of drylands are already degraded, the total area affected by desertification being between 6 and 12 million square kilometers, that about 1–6% of the inhabitants of drylands live in desertified areas, and that a billion people are under threat from further desertification (Johnson et al., 2006; World Bank, 2009). Therefore, it is important to understand the process of desertification, factors contributing to it and interventions needed to combat desertification for enhancing the agricultural productivity and sustaining the environment. Various public and private sector institutions, international and national centers, civil society organizations are working on formulating and implementing programs to combat desertification.

AB  - ABSTRACT Rice cultivation significantly contributes to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, particularly methane released from flooded paddy fields, exacerbating climate change. At the same time, rice farming is highly sensitive to climate conditions, with climate change introducing various abiotic stresses, notably salinity stress. This is especially critical in coastal regions like Indonesia, where rising sea levels and land degradation worsen the salinity challenge. This review systematically examines salinity stress in coastal rice cultivation, the impact of climate change on salinity dynamics and crop performance, and the potential of innovative regenerative technologies to enhance resilience and create low‐salinity, net‐zero agricultural systems. We conducted a systematic literature review following PRISMA guidelines, supplemented by a bibliometric analysis using Scopus, employing keywords such as “salinity stress”, “rice”, “agriculture”, “climate change” and “regenerative”. From an initial 2,191 articles, 18 were deemed eligible for further analysis. Findings indicate that increased soil salinity adversely affects rice production, yet innovative strategies such as rhizomicrobiome engineering, salt‐tolerant rice varieties, regenerative soil amendments, irrigation management, agricultural practices offer viable solutions to mitigate salinity stress. Furthermore, adopting net‐zero farming practices can help achieve carbon neutrality in agriculture while significantly reducing GHG emissions. This review highlights the need for a collaborative approach among scientists, farmers, and policymakers to scale these innovations, ensuring their implementation not only in Indonesia but also in other regions facing similar challenges, thereby promoting food security and environmental sustainability in the face of climate change.

AB  - Abstract The flash flood-affected wetland region of Bangladesh contributes around 20–25% of the annual Boro rice production, which is vital for local, regional, and national food security. Considering the crucial significance of Boro rice and the growing susceptibility of wetland regions to flash floods and climate change, it is imperative to investigate viable approaches and adaptation methods to reduce the adverse effects on agricultural output. This review study investigated the relationships between wetlands, climate change, and coping mechanisms while incorporating economic and advanced satellite remote sensing approaches. Through a comprehensive analysis of flash flood impacts on Boro rice yield using satellite remote sensing technique, the findings revealed significant adverse effects on the vegetative reproduction of Boro rice in the study areas. Notably, flash floods in 2017 exhibited more pronounced impacts than other years (2018 and 2019), underscoring the urgency for effective and integrated coping strategies to ensure sustainable agricultural production. Consequently, the study identified and discussed probable coping strategies, including changes in cropping patterns through land suitability assessment, evaluating vulnerable areas through vulnerability mapping, analyzing yield forecasting models, and introducing a damage-based crop insurance approach to mitigate farmers’ losses. These probable adaptation strategies will offer viable solutions to address the recurrent issue of flash floods and safeguard sustainable agricultural production in the wetland areas of Bangladesh. Considering the current situation, climate change issues and probable alternative coping strategies are crucial for developing a resilient agricultural system in light of flash floods, ensuring the long-term viability of wetland agriculture. The study outcomes provide valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders in wetland agricultural planning and management to develop proper and long-term sustainable adaptation and mitigation strategies.

AB  - Along with climate warming, extreme heat events have become more frequent, severe, and seriously threaten rice production. Precisely evaluating rice heat levels based on heat duration and a cumulative intensity index dominated by temperature and humidity is of great merit to effectively assess regional heat risk and minimize the deleterious impact of rice heat along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River (MLRYR). This study quantified the response mechanism of daytime heat accumulation, night-time temperature, and relative humidity to disaster-causing intensity in three categories of single-season rice heat (dry, medium, and wet conditions) using Fisher discriminant analysis to obtain the Heat Comprehensive Intensity Index daily (HCIId). It is indicated that relative humidity exhibited a negative contribution under dry heat, i.e., heat disaster-causing intensity increased with decreasing relative humidity, with the opposite being true for medium and wet heat. The Kappa coefficient, combined with heat duration and cumulative HCIId, was implemented to determine classification thresholds for different disaster levels (mild, moderate, and severe) to construct heat evaluation levels. Afterwards, spatiotemporal changes in heat risk for single-season rice through the periods of 1986–2005, 2046–2065 and 2080–2099 under SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 were evaluated using climate scenario datasets and heat evaluation levels carefully constructed. Regional risk projection explicitly revealed that future risk would reach its maximum at booting and flowering, followed by the tillering stage, and its minimum at filling. The future heat risk for single-season rice significantly increased under SSP5-8.5 than SSP2-4.5 in MLRYR. The higher risk would be highlighted in eastern Hubei, eastern Hunan, most of Jiangxi, and northern Anhui. As time goes on, the heat risk for single-season rice in eastern Jiangsu and southern Zhejiang will progressively shift from low to mid-high by the end of the twenty-first century. Understanding the potential risk of heat exposure at different growth stages can help decision-makers guide the implementation of targeted measures to address climate change. The proposed methodology also provides the possibility of assessing other crops exposure to heat stress or other extreme events.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to assess smallholder farmers’ vulnerability to climate change and variability based on the socioeconomic and biophysical characteristics of Chiredzi District, a region that is susceptible to the adverse effects of climate change and variability. Design/methodology/approach Vulnerability was assessed using the Vulnerability to Resilience and the Climate Vulnerability and Capacity frameworks. Findings The major indicators and drivers of vulnerability were identified as droughts, flash floods, poor soil fertility and out-migration leaving female- and child-headed households. From sensitivity analysis, it was shown that different areas within the district considered different biophysical and socioeconomic indicators to climate change and variability. They also considered different vulnerability indicators to influence the decisions for adaptation to climate change and variability. Originality/value The results of this study indicate that the area and cropping systems are greatly exposed and are sensitive to climatic change stimuli, as shown by the decline in main cereal grain yield. These results also showed that there is a need to define and map local area vulnerability as a basis to recommend coping and adaptation measures to counter climate change hazards.

AB  - The impacts of climate-related risks on rural–urban linkages and the food systems on which urban settlements depend are poorly understood. This study analysed (i) the climate trends for Blantyre City and rural Chikwawa district in Malawi, (ii) the sources of foods typically consumed in these locations, (iii) the implications of flooding following Tropical Cyclone Idai on urban and rural households' interconnected agri-food systems and food security. Although floods were reported to cause both positive and negative effects on food production; food flows between rural and urban areas; and household food security, the negative effects (i.e. destruction of crops, homes and transport routes; higher food prices) outweighed the positives. In both rural and urban areas, poorer households were disproportionately affected resulting in reduced dietary diversity and food intake, shifts to consumption of cheaper foods, and requests for emergency food donations. Given the rapid rate of urbanisation, better understanding of food security amongst urban households is required. Following extreme events such as flooding, special attention needs to be directed to assessing and addressing food availability, access and consumption challenges in both urban and rural areas reliant on interconnected agricultural and food flows, and particularly in poor households.

AB  - ABSTRACT The yield of corn is strongly affected by climatic conditions during the growing season. In the central region of Argentina, this crop is mainly managed under rainfed conditions. Hence, in most years, it is subjected to drought at some period during the growing season. El Niño Southern Oscillation ( ENSO ) is known to influence rainfall in this region, mainly during the warm semester, hence affecting summer crops yields. This study assessed the relationship between ENSO [analysed through the June–July–August Oceanic Niño Index ( JJA‐ONI )] and corn yields in the provinces of Buenos Aires, Entre Ríos and Santa Fe, which is the main corn‐growing area in Argentina. This was performed for two contrasting periods regarding technology applied in the agricultural sector: 1972–1991 and 1992–2012. Remarkable increases in corn yield between periods were found for the entire region. Except for the province of Entre Ríos, we found statistically significant differences between periods in the trends of corn yield by performing the Chow test. Significant correlations ( P JJA‐ONI and corn yield were found in many counties of Buenos Aires, Entre Ríos and Santa Fe provinces. The correlation was higher in the second period for most counties. We consider that two hypotheses could explain this correlation increase: (1) in previous decades the best growing seasons (from a climatic point of view) were not fully exploited because of a low use of inputs and technology; and (2) the correlation between the ONI and rainfall could have increased in the last decades. We confirmed the latter hypothesis with rainfall data from conventional meteorological stations of 11 locations of the region under analysis. The JJA‐ONI assessed in this research is available before farmers make their most relevant corn management decisions (fertilizer dose, sowing date, density, etc.), thus making this index highly valuable.

AB  - Abstract Integrated agriculture and forestry land-use practices are critical in countries like Sudan, which faces accelerated deforestation, as they can make land-use and agricultural production systems more sustainable. The accelerated loss of forest vegetation is often perceived to result from increased unsustainable exploitation by poor rural populations for their livelihood needs. To explore this critique, we examined smallholder farmers' (SHFs) views on the management and utilization of trees for livelihood improvement and environmental protection. The study involved a cross-sectional survey conducted with SHFs from two villages in Kosti province through questionnaire-based interviews, focus group discussions, and Participatory Learning and Action methodology. Descriptive statistics suggest that forest product exploitation by SHFs has the potential to be sustainable, and is important for both subsistence and income generation. Management strategies adopted by the SHFs to ensure improved yields include (a) the use of drought-tolerant crop varieties; and (b) tree management practices such as assisted natural regeneration, pollarding, and selective harvesting. Such practices are viewed as valuable land-use technologies by SHFs in Sudan to reduce the loss of forest and woodlands that is speeding up environmental degradation. This study concludes that SHFs have a wide range of experience and practical knowledge relevant to ensure and achieve a sustainable management of natural resources and environmental protection alongside livelihood improvement.

AB  - One-fourth of the total tea production in India comes from smallholder tea estates, thus signifying the importance of this land use in biomass carbon management.As small-scale tea plantation management provides livelihood security to the growers, they prefer to manage such plantation over a long period of time and therefore maintaining a permanent sink of carbon.In the present study from Barak Valley part of North East India, such smallholder plantations were assessed for carbon stock in tea bushes, shade trees and soil compartment.Allometric equation for tea plants developed from this region was used for estimation of biomass carbon stock in tea bushes, while species-specific volume equations were used for shade trees.Carbon stock of biomass, litter layer and soil compartment in smallholder tea plantations were estimated as 30.50Mg, 5.54 Mg and 122.17 ± 9.82 Mg C ha -1 up to 1 m depth respectively.Shade tree compartment contributed a dominant proportion (56.37%) of biomass and carbon stock compared to tea bushes (25.46%) and litter layer (18.17%).Collectively soil compartment holds maximum proportion (80%) of carbon stock followed by shade tree (11%), tea bush (5%) and litter (4%) compartments in the system.Comparatively carbon stock in smallholder tea estate is lower than many of the tropical and subtropical forestry and agroforestry systems.Nonetheless, the former sustains the livelihood of million of farmers across the tropical world and simultaneously maintains a permanent sink of carbon.Further studies are required to better understand the tea agroforestry arrangement to promote sink capability of smallholder tea estates.

AB  - Agricultural water interventions (AWI), e.g. in-situ soil and water conservation strategies, irrigation, and damming of rivers to increase groundwater recharge, have been suggested as important strategies to improve yields in tropical agriculture. Although the biophysical implications of AWIs have been well investigated, the coupling between the biophysical changes and the economic implications thereof is less well understood. In this study we translate the results from a hydrological model, SWAT, on crop yields for different cropping systems with and without agricultural water interventions, to hypothetical farm incomes for a watershed, Kothapally, located in Andhra Pradesh, India. It was found that on average, AWI significantly improved farm incomes by enabling the cultivation of a high value crop during the monsoon season (cotton), supplementary irrigated to bridge dry spells and replacing a traditional crop (sorghum), and also by enhancing the capacity to produce dry season, fully irrigated vegetable crops, in this case exemplified by onion. AWI combined with cotton resulted in more than a doubling of farm incomes compared to traditional sorghum-based systems without AWI during normal and wet years (i.e. for 75% of the years). Interestingly, we observed that the difference between the AWI system and the no intervention system was larger during years of high average rainfall compared to dry years. It was also found that access to irrigation was more important for farm income than crop choice and AWI per se, and thus farms with access irrigation benefitted more from AWI compared to farmers lacking access to irrigation. In conclusion, we suggest that in order to assess equity aspects in terms of farm income generation following the implementation of an AWI project, there is a need for income analyses at the farm level, since income estimates at the watershed level may mask important differences in economic benefits between farms.

AB  - Abstract The study aims to assess the local adaptation measures used by farmers to cope with the impacts of climate variability in the Hulbarag district, Silte zone, central Ethiopia. Purposive, stratified, and systematic random sampling techniques were employed to collect primary data from a household survey of 207 household heads through well-administered questionnaires, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews. The weighted average index method and multinomial logistic regression were used for analyzing farmers’ adaptation index and determinants of adaptation efficacy status. The findings show that 83.5% of the participants have responded to the impacts of climate variability by utilizing at least one adaptation technique. However, 16.5% of the participants didn’t employ any type of adaption technique. Fertilization and manure application, migration, and rainwater harvesting were the three most common adaptation strategies. Yet, 46% of respondents indicated that their adaptation measures are not effective at reducing the negative consequences of climate variability. The effectiveness of adaptation is significantly influenced by agroecological zones, farmers’ perceptions of the effects of climate variability, and their trust in climate information. Lack of input resources, lack of information, and lack of water have been identified as major obstacles to adaptation efforts. Programs aimed at improving the climate resilience of maize and wheat-growing communities should pay close attention to the value of reliable climate information, improving input resources access and adaptation skills. It is also advised to improve adaptation capacity in the research area’s agroecological zones under site-specific alternative priorities. The use of indigenous drought-tolerant crops such as sorghum should be encouraged to help farmers who grow maize and wheat meet their food needs and maintain their livelihoods during the dry spell.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study is to analyze smallholder farmers’ perceptions on climate change and its stressors, their adaptation strategies and factors that influence their adaptation to climate change. Design/methodology/approach The study was conducted in Kweneng district, located in the south eastern part of Botswana. Multi-stage sampling was used to obtain a representative sample from three sub-districts in the district. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data by using face-to-face interviews. Findings Majority of farmers perceived an increase in mean annual temperature and the number of hot days and a decrease in mean annual rainfall and the number of rainfall days over the past 10 years as indicators of climate change. The prominent adaptation strategies included changes in planting dates for crops and supplementary feeding for livestock. The logistic regression results show that gender, age, household size, poverty, shortage of land, mixed farming and knowledge about climate change significantly influence adaptation. Practical implications The findings indicate that climate change policy should target agricultural diversification at the household level and dissemination of information on climate change and adaptation strategies. Originality/value Policy recommendations can be suggested: government climate change interventions should target agricultural diversification at the household level, and this study provides insights on what influences adaptation strategies and what should be targeted to build resilience in the agricultural sector.

AB  - Climate change has major impacts to the livelihoods of the rural communities. In order to counteract the situation communities have developed various means for coping and adapting to the impacts. This paper reviews the various adaptation strategies by which different local communities (fishermen, pastoralists and farmers) in Tanzania have developed and discusses the sustainability of some of the strategies. It has been documented that farmers in Tanzania use traditional practices such as terracing (matuta), ngolo, tree planting, and construction of locally based water reservoirs (nkunisa), mixed cropping and crop diversification. Pastoralists use strategies such as ngitiri, rain water harvesting in ditches (malambo), check dams and engagement in alternative economic activities; and fishermen use methods such as change in fishing time, deep water fishing, scheduling particular time for fishing and engagement in other alternative economic activities. Based on the ability of the strategy to improve the capacity of the communities to respond to climate change effects, ease of implementation, the affordability, the strategies have been categorized as sustainable or not. It has been noted that the use of the sustainable indigenous strategies can improve the management of climate change effects provided that the underlying limitations are overcome. The limitations to the effectiveness of some of the documented coping and adaptation strategies may arise for instance from failure to fit the local context. It is therefore concluded that the analysis of a number of scenarios need to be undertaken prior to replication of any strategy.

AB  - Agriculture plays a key role in ensuring food and livelihood security in South Asia. However, this region is vulnerable to climate change which is likely to impact the livelihoods of millions of marginal and small holders. Agriculture is not only impacted by climate change but also one of the major contributor to global warming in South Asia. As compared to the traditional practices, Conservation Agriculture (CA) practices help mitigate the impact of climate change through a reduction in carbon emission and conservation of natural resources. In this article, a meta-analysis of the important studies was done for the impact of CA on carbon sequestration, water use, greenhouse gas emissions and cost and net returns. Carbon sequestration potential was found significantly higher in the CA practices (+16.30%) as compared to the conventional tillage. Inclusion of legumes, clay-rich soils, irrigation and presence of soil cover are the major drivers for higher carbon sequestration potential in the region. Additionally, a significant amount of water was also saved as CA practices led to relatively less consumption of water over the conventional tillage. Further, the adoption of CA based management practices resulted in a substantial reduction of CO2 (−4.28%) and CH4 (−25.67%) emissions both in aerobic and anaerobic soil conditions. However, the emission of NO2 and N2O–N gases were higher under the CA, +14.45 and + 5.20% respectively. Nevertheless, the emission of N2O–N was lesser in CA (−1.78%) under aerobic conditions whereas it is increased under anaerobic soil conditions (+12.15%). The adoption of CA practices resulted in higher returns and lower costs as compared to the conventional system. Although CA has significant environmental benefits, the study suggests judicious use of inorganic inputs under CA for managing the impact of climate change in South Asia. Therefore, CA is a sustainable agricultural practice that deserves outscaling in South Asia for mitigation and adaptation of climate change.

AB  - Abiotic stresses (drought, heat) are one of the major impediments to enhancing the maize productivity of marginal farmers in the facet of climate change. The present study attempts to investigate the impact of heat-tolerant maize hybrid on yield and income in the Terai region of Nepal. This study uses cross-sectional farm household-level data collected in August 2021 from a randomly selected sample of 404 rural households. We used a doubly robust inverse probability weighted regression adjustment method to obtain reliable impact estimates. Adoption of heat-tolerant hybrid increases yields by 16% and income by 44% in the spring season (a stress condition). Overall, yield increases by 12%, net income by 31%, saving of 40% in seed costs, and per capita food expenditure increases by 8.50%. Hence a conducive environment must be created for scaling up heat-tolerant maize varieties to increase productivity, minimize risk, and transform of the maize sector.

AB  - Flood is the major cause of fatalities associated with natural disasters in the world. In India especially in the state of Bihar, where about half of the area (North Bihar) gets flooded every year due to the overflow of major rivers during the rainy season. Which severely affects human lives, properties, agricultural production, farmers and their livelihood. Usually, the basins of the Kosi and Gandak rivers are known for their worst affects in Bihar. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is widely used for robust monitoring of flood events due to its ability to image the surface of the earth in all weather conditions. However, limited studies are available on flood patterns of Bihar and their impact on agriculture. Here, we investigated the flood extents and affected paddy rice fields for Bihar during the months of June–October (2020) using all accessible Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 MSI images with additional supporting datasets available on the Google Earth Engine. The study showed that a large portion of Bihar (7019 km2) was submerged during monsoon season. The floodwater remains in the agricultural fields for 50 to 65 days causing severe damage to the Kharif crops, mainly rice. The extreme effect of flood was seen in agricultural lands (11.23% of the total area) and populations (15.56% of the total population) in Bihar. Satellite-based identification of flood progression and affected rice fields can be helpful for decision-makers at the time of disaster to prioritize relief and rescue operations.

AB  - ABSTRACT Conventional social protection programmes that fail to intentionally consider climate change effects in their design and delivery are criticised for not addressing the root causes of vulnerability to climate change, particularly for rural livelihoods. Increasingly, we see a shift to adaptive social protection programming to address climate vulnerability, which incorporates transformative objectives. However, there is a dearth of research into the transformative effects of adaptive approaches. Addressing this gap, we employ a “rights-based approach” to assess how adaptive social protection affords greater transformative resilience and wellbeing outcomes over conventional social protection programming. Taking Bangladesh as our case, empirical data show that although social protection programming incorporates some transformative elements, their impacts in terms of subjective resilience and wellbeing outcomes are limited. These limited outcomes result from prevailing clientelism, inadequate benefits paid to participants, lack of beneficiary participation in decision-making, and failure to address unequal gender norms and power relations. These failures are intentionally obscured through the performative practice of corrupted reporting. We conclude by proposing social protection features that are expected to promote more equitable, inclusive and just pathways to sustainably reduce climate induced vulnerability of subsistence farmers.

AB  - SOIL health refers to its capacity to sustain multiple ecosystem services(ESs) for human wellbeing and nature conservancy through coupled cycling of carbon with other elements. Among numerous key indicators, soil organic matter (SOM) content is widely considered the heart of soil health. However, most cropland soils of Africa in general and that of Sub-Saharan Africa(SSA) in particular have been subject to anthropogenic climate change, in which soil has been a source of greenhouse gases since the dawn of settled agriculture, and thus leading to reduction in SOM content and aggravation of other degradation processes. The optimum level of SOM content may range from 2-4% for soils of the temperate climate compared with 1.5-2.5%% in those of tropical regions. However, soils of most agro-ecosystems in Africa have been subjected to land misuse and soil mismanagement, and thus are, severely depleted of their SOM content because of extractive farming practices. These systems can lead to a negative nutrient budget and thus mining of nutrients with the attendant severe depletion of SOM content in the root zone to often as low as 0.25% or less. Thus, agronomic productivity, use-efficiency of inputs (e.g., fertilizers, irrigation, energy-based farm operations, seeds of improved varieties or choice of other species of animals or plants) and the nutritional quality of food produced is low. The way food is produced and consumed in SSA and other ecoregions can adversely affect health of soil, plants, animals, people, ecosystems, and the planetary processes. Extractive farming can disrupt soil-based ―One Health‖ concept. The widely observed trend of a downward spiral aggravated by soil degradation also signifies the importance of inter-connectivity and other laws of ecology and principles of regenerative agriculture. It is thus pertinent that soil health of agro-ecosystems of Africa are restored by re-carbonization of soils and landscape. The term carbon sequestration implies transfer of atmospheric CO2 into long-lived soil/tree C pools so that it is not readily re-emitted into the atmosphere. The wide range of options of sequestration of atmospheric CO2 include oceanic, geological, chemical, and terrestrial. The goal of creating a positive soil/ecosystem C budget in terrestrial biomes can be met by adopting practices in which input of C into the soil/land exceeds the losses by decomposition, erosion, and leaching. Wide range of agronomic management practices, specifically focused on the strategy of producing more from less, include regenerative agriculture, agro-ecology, and of replenishing plant nutrients as CNPK (rather than NPK). Specific climate-resilient practices comprise of a system-based conservation agriculture (CA), cover cropping, complex farming systems, integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) and integration of crops with trees and livestock. Adoption of conservation-effective systems can be promoted through payments to farmers for strengthening of some key ESs such as sequestering C in land-based sinks, improving quality and renewability of water, strengthening below-and-above-ground biodiversity, etc. Such pro-agriculture and pro-farmer policies can be advanced through adoption of a ―Soil Health Act‖ at local, state, national, sub-continental,continental and global scale. © 2024 National Information and Documentation Center (NIDOC).

AB  - Agricultural production (especially intensive rice production) is a primary income source for over 2.0×107 people in the Vietnamese Mekong River Delta. However, adverse climate change impacts, socio-economic change, and high dependence on farm inputs for intensive production constrain the longer-term sustainability of rice systems. Government and agribusiness actors are encouraging more farmers to grow non-rice crops and supporting the upscaling of alternative crops to paddy rice. We used a qualitative approach to investigate the value chain characteristics, as well as constraints and opportunities of alternative crops via two case studies (baby corn and honeydew melon) in An Giang and Hau Giang provinces, Vietnam. Data collection involved focus group discussions with local farmers and interviews with farmers and industry experts. Thematic analysis was used to compile the findings, and the results were validated with local government staff. The baby corn value chain featured on-going and stable market demand (including value-addition) and better vertical coordination (e.g., written contracts and financial support). The honeydew melon value chain featured positive relationships between farmers and traders despite less-developed vertical coordination. There are opportunities for value chain engagement through product quality certification, value-addition, and accessing high-value domestic and export markets. However, farmers require crop-specific and generic support from private and public sectors. Increased labour requirements and limited access to finance and credit limit value chain participation. Upscaling and marketing alternative crops can enhance farmer profitability and support non-farming agricultural business establishment, economic growth, and community development. Efficient value chains will be critical to ensure the adoption of alternative crops and development of crop-specific agribusiness models. These findings can inform policy-makers and change facilitators in designing targeted interventions to support the adoption of alternative crops in the study area as well as in Vietnam and globally.

AB  - Solar energy plays an essential role in achieving carbon goals and mitigating climate change. Therefore, solar power plants are rapidly developing in the renewable energy sector. However, many reports of solar power plants are on land, and extremely limited observational research has been conducted on the impacts of fishery complementary photovoltaic power plants (FPVs) on near-surface meteorology and surface energy. This study selected two adjacent eddy covariance observational towers at the fishery complementary photovoltaic power plant (FPV) in Yangzhong, Jiangsu Province, China, to explore this topic. The results indicated that the percent frequency of east wind (<4 m s−1) at 2 m decreased by 25.3% in the FPV site compared with the reference site. The FPV array has not an obvious heating effect on the ambient environment. The average air temperature difference in the two sites at 2 m and 10 m was 0.3 K and 0.1 K, respectively, during the heating period. The net radiation increased by 47.8 W m−2 in the two sites. The sensible heat increased by 7.9 W m−2 due to the heating effect. The latent heat in the two sites is contrary to the sensible heat (−13.0 W m−2). The difference in the water storage heat is 32.18 W m−2, which implies that the water absorbs higher heat in the FPV site than in the reference site. This work illustrated the importance of observational experiments to animate process-based understanding combined with FPV systems and provides a scientific basis for establishing FPV energy balance models based on observations that may be used to reveal the impact of utility-scale FPV deployment on climatic effects.

AB  - The Japanese scallop (Mizuhopecten yessoensis) is an important commercial species in the Dalian coastal area. The present study employed a suitable aquaculture site-selection model (SASSM) and used satellite remote-sensing data to analyze the spatiotemporal distribution of suitable areas for Japanese scallop aquaculture in the Dalian coastal area from 2003 to 2012. The study area was divided into four marine zones. The results demonstrated that the suitability scores of scallop aquaculture areas were high in May and low in February. The Changhai County (Zone II) and Lushunkou areas (Zone III) exhibited high potential for Japanese scallop aquaculture development. The results of the suitability models were consistent with the existing scallop aquaculture in the study area. These zones, combined with climatic events [the winter East Asian Monsoon (EAM) and El Niño/La Niña–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events], were used to examine the impact of climate variability on scallop aquaculture. Results suggest that the suitability scores in Zone III were more sensitive to changes in environmental factors (e.g., sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a, and suspended sediment) and climate changes, whereas the correlations among these factors were not significant in Zone II. Adaptation to these changes should be considered when developing plans and management strategies for scallop aquaculture.

AB  - The surging climate change and variability impacts are multiplying complex
qualitative and quantitative threats to poor and vulnerable smallholder farm-
ing dependent populations in Sub-Saharan Africa ( IPCC, 2007). Thus, cli-
mate change impacts and their effects are increasing vulnerability to severe
food insecurities due to disrupted smallholder farming livelihoods activities.
Indeed, vulnerability to climate change risks and hazards is worsened by other
non-climate change factors such as poverty, wars and other natural disasters
(Adger, 2006; IPCC, 2007). Unfortunately, the prevalence of these disasters
and the absence of robust climate change policies reduce smallholder farmers’
potential in building strong resilience and robust adaptive capacity.
The growing literature on smallholder farming and adaptation pointed out
the need to embrace local institutions’ in various processes (Agrawal, 2008).
Local institutions are largely credited for their unmatched contributions in
bringing the missing but, relevant assets/capitals such as, financial capital,
modern technology and technical expertise.
It is against this background this chapter interrogates the contribution of
local institutions (civil, private and public) in building vulnerable smallholder
farmers’ adaptive capacity against droughts and food insecurities. Firstly, we
identified various local institutions which are actively involved helping small-
holder farmers in ward 20, 21, and 24 in adaptation. Secondly, we investigated
various adaptive strategies introduced in effort to build adaptive capacity and
resilience against severe droughts. Lastly, we assessed the potentials and chal-
lenges encountered by both local institutions and smallholder farmers in com-
plex intervention processes of adaptation.

AB  - The grapevine is regarded as a drought-resistant crop, although in recent years it has been observed to be threatened by climate change (CC). This compelled an investigation into the adaptation strategies used by grapevine farmers to lessen the impacts of climate change in Dodoma, Tanzania. The impacts of CC on grapevine farming were explored, and the adopted adaptation strategies were examined. About 248 grapevine farmers, and 64 key informants and members of focus group discussions were involved in the study. Data were collected through surveys, discussions, interviews, observations, and reviews. Quantitative data were analysed through descriptive statistics while qualitative data were analysed using thematic analysis. Findings indicate that the major impacts of CC on grapevine production include the outbreak of grapevine diseases (76.2%), occurrence of pests and insects (67.6%), drought (26.9%), and extreme temperatures (10%). To moderate these impacts, grapevine farmers have adopted several adaptation strategies, such as applying pesticides (63.2%), implementing irrigation (21.3%), paroling to prevent birds (6.8%), and using manure (5.6%) to improve soil fertility. These findings inform that CC has a direct detrimental impact on grapevine production including uncertainties which affect grapevine markets, and the adaptation strategies for the CC impacts in the study areas are in place. It is recommended that the Tanzania government and other grapevine stakeholders should help grapevine farmers to improve and take on board existing adaptation strategies against CC through agricultural extension services, and enable farmers’ access to financial capital. This could improve grapevine farmers’ adaptive capacity to CC.

AB  - Rice is an important crop grown globally under different climatic and soil conditions. However, the effects of the interplay between climate variability (CV) and land use changes on rice production have not been well addressed, especially in developing countries like Nigeria. Thus, a case study was undertaken in Adani, Enugu state, Nigeria. The aim is to provide further insight on CV and land use interactions and influence on the trend of rice productivity in the study area. The study utilised climate data and satellite imageries of the area. Primary data on perception of farmers regarding rice productivity was also obtained through questionnaire. The climate data was analysed using non-parametric time series analysis (Mann-Kendall and Sen’s slope estimator), while the satellite imageries were analysed using GIS and remote sensing. Results demonstrate that CV has occurred in the area, with noticeable inter-annual fluctuations. The trend shows statistical significance for maximum temperature, rainfall, modified Fournier-Maule index, relative humidity and solar irradiance, while the trend for minimum and mean temperatures and wind speed were statistically insignificant. Within the study period, land cover for the various land use patterns; bare land, built up area and water body increased, whereas vegetation cover diminished. Based on farmers’ data, rice productivity has declined, which is associated with the effects of CV that has affected the land use pattern, in addition to the topography of Adani. The primary concerns believed to be responsible for decline in rice productivity are leaching of nutrients and deposition of toxic metals from resultant flooding effect. Adaptation strategies are therefore recommended in form of remediation methods, particularly phyto-remediation and the utilisation of irrigation facilities in Adani to mitigate the adverse effects that hamper rice productivity.

AB  - The effects of climate change on the agricultural sector in developing countries have been discussed to a considerable extent in scientific and political circles. This study focuses on the effects of climate change on the agricultural sector and investigates adaptation measures and their effects on agricultural water consumption. Specifically, this study investigates how farmers’ adaptation measures in response to climate change affect water consumption. A choice model was first used to study the factors influencing the adoption of strategies to adapt to climate change by farmers. Then, an endogenous switching regression model and counterfactual analysis were applied to quantify the effect of adaptation strategies on water consumption. To assess the effectiveness of the model introduced, farmers of Bavi County in Khuzestan province, Iran, were chosen as a sample population. Data were collected in a survey of 335 farmers using a multi-stage random sampling method in 2022-2023. The findings indicated that education, access to agricultural extension services, age, and proximity to the market significantly influenced the adoption of adaptation measures. Analysis of various scenarios demonstrated that farmers implementing adaptation strategies had notably lower average water consumption compared to those who did not. Specifically, water management practices had the most substantial effect, reducing water usage by 2277 m 3 ha -1 . These results are valuable for informing the development of public policies and agricultural extension programs aimed at promoting successful adaptation strategies among farmers.

AB  - Agricultural productivity in South Africa is negatively affected by drought as a result of frequent periodic dry spells and increasing crop water demands resulting in poor crop development and low yields. Thus, we embarked on this study which aims at investigating dry spell occurrences in relation to growing season of maize in the Luvuvhu River Catchment. Daily rainfall data (1945–2014) from 12 stations which represent the catchment fairly well was utilized in this study. Three consecutive planting dates were staggered based on three consecutive onsets of the rainy season. Dry spells were categorized into three groups: short, medium and long dry spells. The data was then subjected to theoretical distribution fitting using the Anderson–Darling goodness-of-fit test; and probabilities of occurrence were computed using a probabilistic model that best fits the data. Trend analysis was performed on the frequency of dry spells per growing period using the non-parametric Spearman's rank correlation test. Out results indicated high probabilities (≥80%) of short dry spells at all the stations irrespective of the timing of planting. Further analysis revealed that a risk of yield reduction with planting following the first onset of rains was higher than that with planting following the second and third onsets. In order to minimize this risk, farmers can be advised to plant between mid-November to mid-December. Trend analysis indicated no trend for all the various dry spell lengths except for Thohoyandou with a decreasing trend and Sigonde with a weak increasing trend in long dry spells. Such findings can be used to describe drought conditions for improvement of agricultural productivity and food security, in a given area.

AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic resulted in widespread and devastating physical, emotional, societal, and economic repercussions among workers in India. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of COVID-19 and to understand the challenges faced and coping mechanism adopted among fishermen community from the coastal area of Karnataka. METHODOLOGY: This community-based mixed-methods study included participants from a coastal Karnataka fishermen’s community. Questionnaire based personal interviews collected information on sociodemographics, COVID-19 diagnosis, treatment, and related costs, COVID-19-appropriate behavior and were screened using DASS-21. Focus group discussions and key informant interviews were conducted to acquire qualitative data. RESULTS: Quantitative data collection involved 107 participants, predominantly males [70.1%], aged between 46–60 years [37.4%] and low socioeconomic status [79.4%]. Among 107, 51 participants reported to have probable COVID-19 symptoms. Around 11% had tested for COVID-19 and two were admitted in hospital with mean hospital stay of seven days. According to DASS-21, 20.6%, 15.9% and 9.3% of participants screened positive for depression, anxiety and stress respectively. Nearly one third of the participants were found to have significant socioeconomic impact.Major challenges faced included loss of livelihood, inaccessibility to health care, repayment of loans, stigma related to COVID-19 and meeting educational expenses of children with one dropping out of college. Activities of local self-help groups in the community and grass root level marketing strategies to sell fish were highly successful in mitigating the impact as a community. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 had a significant impact on fishermen community and implies a need for better pandemic and disaster preparedness strategies in the community.

AB  - This study assessed the effects of different grazing pressures (light, moderate and heavy) on rangeland condition and woody species diversity in northeastern Ethiopia. Rangeland condition was analyzed using common protocols for the assessment of semi-arid rangelands. A total of 4 grasses, 5 herbs, 1 sedge and 14 tree and/or shrub species were identified. Results show that grazing intensity had detrimental effects on condition of the rangeland, and caused undesirable changes in herbaceous species composition. The contribution of undesirable plants to herbaceous aboveground biomass was particularly high (40 %) compared to the 30 % contributed by highly desirable species. Nearly all measures of range condition were negatively affected by grazing. Grass composition, number of seedlings and age distribution, basal and litter cover, soil erosion and compaction decreased significantly as grazing intensity increased. Species richness and diversity (Hill numbers) of woody plants were reduced significantly by grazing. The overall condition of the rangeland was generally poor. The pastoralists perceived that recurring droughts, heavy continuous grazing and inappropriate management interventions, and bush encroachment were the main contributing factors that led to overgrazing and rangeland deterioration in the area. In conclusion, our study shows that livestock grazing in northeastern Ethiopia degrade range condition and woody vegetation, and its effects are sever under moderate and heavy grazing. Management measures such as resting of the rangelands preferably with stock exclusions for 6–12 months or protecting heavily degraded or sensitive areas from livestock activity and reseeding may be the viable options to mitigate declines in range conditions.

AB  - Abstract This review explores the intricate landscape of food system resilience in Sub‐Saharan Africa (SSA), focusing on the region's unique challenges and vulnerabilities. SSA confronts a myriad of obstacles, including climate change impacts, inadequate infrastructure and limited access to resources. Nevertheless, our analysis reveals promising drivers of food system resilience that offer a path forward. We emphasize the substantial potential inherent in SSA countries to bolster food system resilience (FSR). Abundant agricultural resources, genetic diversity and a youthful population represent untapped assets that can transform the region's food systems. Strategies such as diversifying suppliers, empowering local farmers and reducing reliance on external sources emerge as pivotal steps to fortify SSA's food system resilience. These initiatives enhance self‐sufficiency and foster economic growth and sustainable practices throughout SSA. Furthermore, our review underscores the crucial role of educational programmes and farmer training initiatives in building local capacity. Equipping communities with sustainable agricultural practices and market insights at the grassroots level reinforces resilience. Additionally, knowledge‐sharing platforms and stakeholder collaboration bridge gaps and facilitate the dissemination of best practices. In the digital age, harnessing technology and data becomes paramount in strengthening SSA's food system resilience. Digital tools and data‐driven approaches offer valuable insights and support adaptive strategies. By integrating these multifaceted drivers, SSA can embark on a comprehensive and holistic journey towards a more resilient and secure food system.

The assumed positive relationship between fallow length and crop yields has long shaped such negative opinions on the sustainability and environmental impact of the system, as population growth is believed inevitably to lead to its collapse. Empirical evidence for this assumption is scarce, however, and a better understanding of system dynamics is needed before discarding shifting cultivation as unsustainable. With cases from Malaysia and Indonesia, we show that fallow length is a weak predictor of crop yields, though interactions with fertilizer inputs may increase its importance. Other factors such as drought, flooding, and pests are more important determinants of yields. The implication is that when using natural fallow as the only means of nutrient supply, there is no need to cut old fallow vegetation. Moreover, there is no evidence of system collapse, even at short fallow periods. We conclude that shifting cultivation should be accepted as a rational land use system and that earlier calls for bringing a “Green Revolution” to shifting cultivators are still relevant to achieve intensive and sustainable production.

AB  - Teff is an important crop for smallholder farmers in Ethiopia. Improved crop management practices are needed to increase teff productivity and decrease production costs. Here, we used a split–split plot design to evaluate the impacts of different tillage, sowing, and soil compaction practices, and their combinations, on agronomic performance, weed population, lodging, and cost in teff production at the Aba Gerima watershed in northwestern Ethiopia in 2018–2020. Reduced tillage (RT) improved soil moisture, resulting in increased agronomic performance and decreased production costs compared with conventional tillage (CT); however, the weed population was substantially larger with RT than with CT. Row planting (RP) reduced seed cost and lodging but increased sowing and weeding costs compared with broadcast planting (BP). Plant population and leaf area index were substantially greater with BP than with RP during early-stage growth, but this reversed during late-stage growth. Despite labor costs being significantly greater with (WC) compaction than without (NC), little to no differences were observed in the weed population or in agronomic performance. Partial cost–benefit analysis revealed that RT–RP–WC followed by RT–RP–NC was the most economical treatment combination, suggesting that RT–RP–NC could be a labor-effective means of increasing teff production by smallholder farms in Ethiopia.

AB  - The balance between water demand and availability in Romania, as well as in many areas of Europe, will soon reach a critical level if predictions by simulated climate change scenarios are correct. The article is focused on the risk of water shortages, due to the climate change, in the Timiş Plain in Romania, a densely populated region, with 346,818 inhabitants. Estimates of future water availability for public water supply consider relevant socio-economic scenarios for major water users, estimate their future water demand, and assess water shortage for the main users. The water demand components were estimated for households, industries, services, and livestock, based on specific socio-economic assumptions. A non-probabilistic risk assessment, using simplified fuzzy sets mathematics, considers water supply, water demand and the consequences of water shortage. The results of the study revealed a vulnerability of the water supply and sewerage networks, an expected increase in households' demand, in the rural and in the urban, an expected increase for industrial and services water demand and a positive dynamic for the livestock water demand and finally a water shortage in the study area.

AB  - This paper explores the response to risk of smallholder agricultural producers in the face of variable and changing climate in Cameroon. The low rainfall distribution in some regions of the country and the high inter-seasonal variability of rainfall makes crop production, on which the livelihood of rural inhabitants is based, a risky enterprise. Women farmers in Cameroon are an important group for whom risk aversion influences production outcomes and welfare. This study identifies and analyses the effect of climate risks on the productive activities and the management options of male and female farmers. Women-owned farms, on average, record profits of US$ 620 per hectare to about US$ 935 for crop enterprises across the different agroecological zones. Comparatively static results indicate that increases in climate variability and the uncertainty of climate conditions have an explicit impact on farm profit. The impacts of increased uncertainty in climate and risk aversion are ambiguous depending on the agroecology. Ex-ante and ex-post risk management options reveal that female-owned farms in the northern Sahel savannah zone rely on more sophisticated strategies to reduce the impact of shocks. While adapting to uncertain climate positively influences profit levels, risk measured as the variance of rainfall or temperature per unit variation in profit is significant. This analysis stresses the increased importance of climate risk management as a prelude to the panoply of adaptation choice in response to expected climatic change.

AB  - Botswana is a semi-arid, middle-income African country that imports 90 percent of its food. Despite its relative prosperity, Botswana also suffers from one of the highest measures of income inequality in the world, persistent poverty, and relatively high levels of food insecurity. The objective of this paper is to explore how political economy, climate change and livelihood dynamics are synergistically impacting household food security. The major finding is that the marginalization of smallholder farming in Botswana has as much or more to do with domestic, regional and international political economy as it does with climate change. As such, international efforts to support climate change adaptation in Botswana will have a limited effect on smallholder farming livelihoods and rural food security unless such efforts take account of political economic constraints. Effective support must be based on a grounded understanding of the real drivers of marginalization and food insecurity. One initiative that merits further exploration is the government’s backyard gardening initiative, which could be viewed as a pro-poor climate adaptation strategy. The findings of this paper are based on semi-structured interviews with policymakers and surveys with urban, peri-urban and rural households undertaken in 2012 and 2015.

AB  - Climate adaption technology is crucial in alleviating the negative impacts of climate change on agriculture and promoting the sustainability of agricultural development. The aim of this study is to evaluate the influence of farmers' autonomous decision-making and government multi-interventions on the adoption of climate adaption technology, utilizing survey data collected from 528 farmers from the Wei River Basin (WRB) of China. The results revealed that farmers' autonomous decision-making and government multi-interventions significantly stimulate their adaption adoption. Specifically, the effect of restrictive intervention is the most significant, followed by subsidy intervention, while the effect of promotion intervention is relatively weaker. Moreover, government multi-interventions boost consciousness of the economic and ecological benefits, lower negotiation costs, and diminish information asymmetry, thus playing a moderating role between the farmers’ autonomous decision-making and their technology adoption. The analysis of heterogeneity reveals that government multi-interventions have a significant influence on the adoption behavior of climate adaptation technology among farmers characterized by food crop growers, agricultural cooperative members, and low non-agricultural income. Overall, this study provides a micro-level empirical basis for the promotion of technologies aimed at adapting to climate change—specifically water-saving irrigation technology (WSIT) and offers policy recommendations. It also provides insights for the government in formulating effective intervention strategies to enhance sustainable agricultural development and water resources management.

AB  - Using a multistage sampling technique, data were collected from 386 households in four districts of Zimbabwe to investigate current Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) technology combinations smallholder farmers practising integrated crop-livestock farming are adopting, as well as the determinants of adoption. The study used two econometric techniques to address the objectives. Firstly, principal component analysis (PCA) was employed to identify the CSA technology combinations smallholder farmers adopted. Secondly, multinomial logistic regression model was then used to analyze the adoption of the constructed CSA technology bundles. The study identified three prominent technology bundles/combinations. The multinomial logistic selection model results reveal that observable household and market access characteristics influence the likelihood of a farming household adopting any CSA technology bundle. The results highlight that gender of household head, farm characteristics (soil type and labour size) and institutional factors (market access, information access and access to credit) are the main factors that determine the adoption of various CSA technology combinations. Thus, the study recommends that the government should design policies aimed at improving farmers’ knowledge with regards to CSA, including early warning systems and programmes that enhance access to information, markets and credit.

AB  - Abstract Pervasive threats of climate change and land degradation have compounded the inherent low farm productivity problem in sub‐Saharan Africa. Though sustainable agricultural intensification practices have been shown to improve the resilience of farm production in the face of these emerging threats, they suffer low adoption rates typical of any technology adoption in these regions. Recent evidence points to an emergence of large traders in smallholder grain markets of countries in sub‐Saharan Africa. Given their big financial and operational capacities, the hypothesis is that they can drive the elusive transformation in agri‐food systems by enhancing sustainable production and marketing for smallholder farmers. This study tests this hypothesis using a decade‐long large‐panel dataset from Kenya. A dynamic random effects Probit model and a control function approach are used to evaluate the dynamism in adopting sustainable agricultural inputs and the effect of large grain traders in enhancing the adoption of these inputs at the farm level. Results indicate that sales to large grain traders lead to higher adoption of inorganic fertilizer and improved seed, key agricultural intensification inputs. Land ownership is also shown to be a key success factor for entry into large‐grain‐trader markets. Lastly, the adoption of improved seed and organic manure is persistent across time, indicating state dependence in using these inputs. These results suggest that strategies to foster engagements between large grain traders and farmers can enhance the uptake of sustainable intensification inputs. Such strategies should be accompanied by efforts to improve access to these markets by resource‐poor farmers who are primarily smallholders.

AB  - Sugarcane farming is physically demanding and exposes farmers to multiple stressors, increasing their risk of mental health problems. This study aimed to examine stress levels and identify the factors related to stress among sugarcane farmers in Sa Kaeo Province, Thailand. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 276 registered sugarcane growers in Sa Kaeo Province for at least one year using a multi-stage sampling method. Data were gathered through questionnaires between February and April 2025. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multiple logistic regression analysis. The results indicated that most participants experienced high stress (49.3%), followed by moderate stress (25.0%) and severe stress (22.5%). Factors significantly associated with high stress among sugarcane farmers included experienced changes in climate variability, which showed the strongest association, followed by experiencing sugarcane product prices lower than last year, having moderate social support, incurring costs for cultivation of more than 10,000 Baht, lacking access to agricultural water sources, sleeping less than six hours, and sleeping six to seven hours (p

AB  - Periodic drought is a major challenge in drought-prone areas of South Asia. A sample survey of farmers (n = 400) from South Asia was conducted to study the farmers’ perception about drought impacts on their socio-economic status, agro-biodiversity, and adaptation besides public institutions’ drought mitigation measures. The results revealed reduced surface and groundwater availability, soil degradation, partial or complete crop failure, increased agricultural fallows and wastelands, biodiversity loss, decrease in agricultural yields, pasture lands, and livestock in drought-impacted South Asia. About 16–26% of the farmers perceived a reduction in the agricultural area and production of commercial crops and millets in drought-prone areas, while changes in the cropping of pulses, oilseeds, horticultural, and fodder crops were minimal. About 57–92% of respondents showed a reduction in the consumption of fruits, vegetables, dairy products, and fish. Unemployment, migration, reduced farm income, and malnutrition were major socio-economic impacts among respondents (38–46%). Despite sufficient public support as a mitigation strategy, the farmers had poor participation (8–65%) for agri-information and adaptation (7–36%) against drought impacts. Hence, researchers, extension agents, and policymakers must develop efficient ‘participatory-mode’ drought adaptation and mitigation policies in watershed-based semi-arid pastoral and agricultural regions of South Asia and similar agro-ecologies across the globe.

AB  - Smallholder agriculture productivity in the Eastern Cape (EC) of South Africa is declining due to, among other, resource endowment, manure-use dynamics, and low-productive conventional technology. As such, this study assessed the influence of resource availability on various agricultural activities among smallholder farmers in the Tsitsa River catchment of EC. A structured questionnaire (137 participants) and interviews (18 participants) were administered to gather information on the farm typology, resource endowment, and manure-use dynamics. The results from the descriptive statistics showed that many participants (72%) cultivated their crops in gardens, whereas few used the field for crop production (4%). Most farmers used kraal manure to plant various crops in their gardens, and owning cattle provided easy access to manure. However, the lack of transportation for manure field application was raised, resulting in more nutrients being applied to fields closer to the farmhouse than outfields. The Pearson's Chi-square test of association revealed that participants' age and gender had no effect (p > 0.05) on their likelihood of engaging in various agricultural activities and management practices. The principal component analysis results showed five PCs that contributed to the most variability in the area: the type of land under cultivation, livestock numbers, crop fertilisation, irrigation, and the source of manure. Furthermore, using PCA and cluster analysis, three farm typologies were identified: high resource endowered, medium resource endowed, and low resource endowered. This analysis helped us to understand some overlapping data better. It also showed comparable or varied farming practices and management in the study area. The qualitative results indicated several challenges affecting their farm productivity, including climate change, invasive species, theft, lack of infrastructure, and limited resources. When deciding on intervention programmes involving smallholder farmers in rural communities, authorities and governments should use a holistic approach that considers Indigenous knowledge and attitudes.

AB  - There is increasing attention towards understanding the modifying factors influencing the relationship between meteorological information utilization and adopting climate-smart agricultural practices. Much as several studies have established that meteorological information is vital for adopting climate-smart agricultural practices, not much research has been conducted to contextualize the influence of modifying factors in that relationship. The study is derived from a sample of 341 households. Adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices and modifying effects were understood through a series of univariate, bivariant, and linear regression analyses. Findings from the study indicate that the climate-smart agriculture practices adopted most are; intercropping (71.8%), cover cropping (71%), and crop rotation (69.5%), while the least adopted are mulching (2.3%) and minimum tillage (4.1%). The relationship between meteorological information utilization and adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices is influenced by peers’ or community influence, indigenous knowledge or cultural beliefs, and trust. Trust in weather forecasts scored highest in the relationship between meteorological information utilization and adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices (x2=0.01, P = 0.002**). After accounting for the mediating role of trust, meteorological information utilization positively impacted the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices (B = 0.376, t = 2.045, p < 0.05). The Sobel test results indicate that the mediation effect was also significant (Z = 6.45369270, p < 0.000001). Therefore, trust in meteorological information partially accounts for the relationship between meteorological information utilization and adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices. It can be recommended that there is a need for integration of indigenous knowledge in the scientific meteorological information and provision of finer grain forecasts that can be trusted by the end-users in a timely fashion. This will promote meteorological information utilization in the climate-smart agricultural practices adoption decision.

AB  - The domestication of farm animals starting 12,000–15,000 years ago in the Middle East was a seminal achievement in human development that laid the foundation of agriculture as it is known today. Initially, domesticated animals were selected according to phenotype and/or specific traits adapted to a local climate and production system. The science-based breeding systems used today originated with the introduction of statistical methods in the sixteenth century that made possible a quantitative approach to selective breeding for specific targeted traits. Now, with the availability of accurate and reliable DNA analysis, this quantitative approach has been extended to DNA-based breeding concepts that allow a more cost-effective but still quantitative determination of a genomic breeding value (GBV) for individual animals. The impact of these developments was dramatically enhanced with the introduction of reproductive technologies extending the genetic influence of superior individual animals. The first of these was artificial insemination (AI) that started to be developed in the late nineteenth century. Industry uptake of AI was initially slow but increased dramatically following the development of semen extenders, the reduction of venereal disease risk by inclusion of antibiotics, and most significantly the development of effective freezing and cryostorage procedures in the mid-twentieth century. AI is now used in most livestock breeding enterprises, most notably by the dairy industry where more than 90% of dairy cattle are produced through AI in countries with modern breeding structures. Embryo transfer (ET), a technology that for the first time allowed exploitation of the female genetic pool, was made possible through the major advances in the biological sciences in the later part of the twentieth century. Advances in understanding of the reproductive cycle and its hormonal control, the availability of purified gonadotropins, and improved cell and embryo culture procedures all played significant roles. ET is now being increasingly implemented in top end breeding endeavors, particularly in the top 1–2% of a given cattle population. But its real impact is yet to come as ET is the key enabler in the introduction of the next generation of enhanced breeding technologies. ET has already played a key role in advances such as in vitro production of embryos, sexing, cloning, and transgenesis. With the birth of “Dolly,” the cloned sheep, in 1996, a century-old dogma in biology, which inferred that a differentiated cell cannot be reprogrammed into a pluripotent stage, was abolished. Today, through recent developments in molecular cell biology, available protocols are efficient enough to allow commercial application of somatic cloning in the major farm animal species. This will not only further enhance the rate of genetic gain in herds and flocks but through the recent advent of precise genome editing tools allow the production of novel germlines for agricultural and biomedical purposes through the capacity to genetically modify farm animals with targeted modifications with high efficiency. This paves the way for the introduction of the precision breeding concepts needed to respond to future challenges in animal breeding, stemming from matching the demands of ongoing hyperbolic human population growth to the limited availability of arable land and environmental constraints.

AB  - Poverty and biodiversity are concentrated in rural areas of developing countries where incomes fluctuate with seasons and weather extremes. In this paper, we quantify the income stabilizing role of natural biodiversity and forests for rural households in developing countries. We use panel data covering 7,556 households in 23 developing countries, combined with gridded data on droughts, data on natural biodiversity, and data on the timing of the agricultural cycle. We find that droughts during the growing season reduce crop incomes but that these negative shocks are partly offset by increased incomes from forest extraction. We also find that the negative impact of droughts on rural incomes declines with increasing levels of natural biodiversity. An increase in biodiversity by one standard deviation reduces the impact of droughts on rural production to almost zero. These results therefore stress the importance of biodiversity and natural resources for the stability of rural incomes.

AB  - Globally, the experiences show that climate-smart agroforestry (CSAF) can contribute to sustainable agricultural growth and rural transformation while tackling climate change. This study evaluated the interplay between farmers’ knowledge, attitude, and motivation to adopt CSAF. The study used data from 381 farmers surveyed in Bugesera and Rulindo regions, Rwanda. Bugesera, in the semi-arid savannah lowlands, and Rulindo, in the temperate central highlands, were purposively selected for their distinct physiographic features. A questionnaire was used to collect the data and descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation, and binomial logistic regression were performed for data analysis. The results from the correlation analysis showed that various revealed factors, including gender, civil status, education, household size, household poverty level (ubudehe), farm size, farmers’ experience in CSAF, ownership of radio and mobile phone, livestock herd size, farm-river distance, training, and extension visits, influenced farmers’ knowledge in adopting CSAF. The most significant positive correlation was found between owning a mobile phone and farmers’ knowledge, while the weakest positive correlation existed between farmers’ gender and their knowledge of CSAF. These factors equally affected farmers’ attitudes, except for statistically insignificant gender. The most significant positive correlation was between owning a mobile phone and farmers’ attitudes, while the weakest was between extension visits and farmers’ attitudes towards CSAF. Further, results revealed a positively significant relationship between the farmers’ ages and their motivation to adopt CSAF. Additionally, the binomial logit regression analysis showed that farmers knowledgeable with CSAF were 2.5 times more likely to practice CSAF than farmers without such knowledge. Moreover, being motivated by CSAF benefits increased the likelihood of adopting CSAF by 0.6 times compared to unmotivated farmers. By filling the gap in understanding farmers’ knowledge, attitudes, and motivations toward CSAF adoption, this study contributes to advancing sustainable agricultural practices in Rwanda. It provides a blueprint for similar initiatives elsewhere.

AB  - Abstract The adverse effects of climate change on agriculture have been felt across the globe. Smallholder farmers in sub-Sahara Africa are particularly more vulnerable to the effects of climate change leading to loss of income and livelihood thus affecting global food security. Rainwater harvesting (RWH) is emerging as a viable option to mitigate the negative effects of climate change by supporting rain-fed agriculture through supplemental irrigation. However, smallholder farmers are still grappling with a myriad of challenges hindering them from reaping the benefits of their investment in RWH systems. This review explores some of the factors behind the poor performance of RWH systems in Kenya and also seeks to suggest techniques that can be applied to optimize the design parameters for improved performance and the adoption of RWH systems. According to the review, RWH has the potential to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change among smallholder farmers. It allows for crop production beyond the growing season through supplemental irrigation. However, their impacts have been minimal due to the consistent poor performance of RWH systems. This is attributed to inefficiencies in design and construction brought about by lack of required technical skills among RWH system designers and implementers. Proper design and implementation are therefore paramount for better performance and adoption of RWH systems in the region. This will ensure that RWH systems are reliable, technically and economically feasible as well as possess a desirable water-saving efficiency.

AB  - Abstract In northern Nigeria, drought and desertification have grossly affected water available and land carrying capacity for both pastureland and farmlands. Hence, the northerners, particularly, the youthinevitably migrate to the south for greener pasture for themselves and the animals. Most of these youths are uneducated and not skilled to secure employment, they, therefore, become an instrument in the hands of religious bigotry. This climatic change can also result in a rise in sea level, thereby increasing the flood events especially, in Nigeria’s lowlands. These changes have not only caused fierce conflicts buthave additionally brought about the death of thousands and rendered many homeless. The Nigeria Middle Belt has been the region most impacted by violent death resulting from land resource scarcity. The conflict has ensued between contrasting groups when essential resources become scarcely limited. Northern Nigeria accounts for 68% of every fiercedeath due to the issues of land between farmers and pastoralists in 2006 and 2014, a figure not half the reported cases in 2018 alone. The inadequacies in the Nigerian adaptation efforts to its dwindling climate could be attributed to corruption, institutional shortcomings and political will predisposes the country to more dangers of environmental change impacts. Therefore, climate change mitigating and adaptation measures, unbiased and efficient conflict management strategies, as well as the improved condition of living must be ensured by the government stakeholders to safecurrent and future generations of the country from havocs due to climate impacts.

AB  - The detrimental consequences of heat stress due to high ambient temperatures, particularly in the poultry industry, have led to the invention of several adaptation strategies. However, there is still limited information on the intensity of adaptations and the likely behavioural factors that influence farmers' decisions. Thus, understanding the practical adaptation behaviours of poultry farmers would improve our knowledge of the fundamental mechanisms for developing effective interventions. To fill this void, using a count data model, the study empirically examines the farmers' behavioural factors and the intensity of heat stress adaptation strategies’ adoption among poultry farmers in Ondo State, Nigeria. The data were drawn from a survey of 150 poultry farmers using a multistage sampling procedure. The empirical results show that the majority of the farmers perceived an increase in temperature, frequently experienced heat stress, and believed that heat stress is induced by climate change. An average of six adaptation strategies were simultaneously adopted to mitigate heat stress in the area. The results of the count regression model reveal that farm-level factors such as permanent water sources, the quantity of feed, and bird stock density exert a significant effect on the intensity of adaptations. Climate-related factors such as access to climate information, training participation, perceived increases in temperature, attitudes toward climate change, and motives for adoption have a significant behavioural effect on the intensity of adaptations. Likewise, variables such as poultry farming experience, educational status, and access to credit are accounted for as socioeconomic behavioural factors that influence the intensity of adopting heat stress adaptation strategies in the area. This concludes that behavioural factors are crucial in addressing heat stress adaptations and assisting in improving environmental management, which would form a key variable in the policy interventions.

AB  - Forest resources have continued to play a significant role in the livelihood system of rural communities and the ongoing fight against climate change. Consequently, several efforts have been made to preserve forest resources and strengthen sustainable forest resource management. One of such efforts is the REDD+ program – an incentive-based and demand-driven approach to promote forest protection and enhancement of standing forest stocks in developing countries. This chapter examines how Nigeria’s forest governance and land-use system, forest resource use, and forest management practices can affect the successful implementation of the REDD+ program. Drawing from an empirical survey of four hundred and fifty rural households across different ecological zones in Nigeria, the chapter identified the level of dependence of rural households on forest resources for livelihood sustenance, different governance practices such as property rights and access, and management practices such as shifting cultivation and discussed the implications of these for REDD+ implementation. The chapter also examined the potentialities of the REDD+ program to guarantee the protection of the rights of forest dwellers. It questions whether REDD+ is serving the interest of the developed or developing countries, the rich or the poor. It is argued that successful implementation of the REDD+ program in rural West Africa will depend on its ability to support the livelihoods, indigenous rights, and preservation of cultural/religious values of the forest target communities. Without such considerations, such a scheme will not promote substantial forest management and improved carbon storage in tropical ecosystems. Furthermore, agroforestry, due to its widespread practice as a climate change adaptation option, was recommended as a compromise between forest livelihood objectives and forest conservation objectives.

AB  - Rice production in Nigeria is vulnerable to climate risks and rice farmers over time have experienced the risks and their respective impacts on rice farming. Rice farmers have also responded to perceived climate risks with strategies believed to be climate-smart. Farmers’ perception of climate risks is an important first step of determining any action to be taken to counteract the negative effects of climate change on agriculture. Studies on the link between perceived climate risks and farmers’ response strategies are increasing. However, there are limited studies on the determinants of rice farmers’ perception of climate events. The paper therefore examined climate change perception and uptake of climate-smart agriculture in rice production in Ebonyi State, Nigeria using cross-sectional data from 347 rice farmers in an important rice-producing area in Nigeria. Principal component analysis, multivariate probit regression model and descriptive statistics were adopted for data analysis. Perceived climate events include increased rainfall intensity, prolonged dry seasons, frequent floods, rising temperature, severe windstorms, unpredictable rainfall pattern and distribution, late onset rain, and early cessation of rain. Farmers’ socioeconomic, farm and institutional characteristics influenced their perception of climate change. Additionally, rice farmers used a variety of climate-smart practices and technologies to respond to the perceived climate events. Such climate-smart practices include planting improved rice varieties, insurance, planting different crops, livelihood diversification, soil and water conservation techniques, adjusting planting and harvesting dates, irrigation, reliance on climate information and forecasts, planting on the nursery, appropriate application of fertilizer and efficient and effective use of pesticides. These climate-smart agricultural measures were further delineated into five broad packages using principal component analysis. These packages include crop and land management practices, climate-based services and irrigation, livelihood diversification and soil fertility management, efficient and effective use of pesticide and planting on the nursery. High fertilizer costs, lack of access to inputs, insufficient land, insufficient capital, pests and diseases, floods, scorching sun, high labour cost, insufficient climate information, and poor extension services were the barriers to uptake of climate-smart agriculture in rice production. Rice farmers should be supported to implement climate-smart agriculture in rice production in order to achieve the objectives of increased rice productivity and income, food security, climate resilience and mitigation.

AB  - Abstract Reducing multidimensional poverty in rural areas remains a major challenge for sustainable development in Côte d’Ivoire, where the majority of the population depends on agriculture for their livelihood. This study examines the impact of agricultural diversification on multidimensional poverty among rural households. Using data from the nationally representative 2018–2019 EHCVM survey, and applying Simpson’s diversification index and the Alkire-Foster multidimensional poverty index, we assess how crop diversification influences deprivation in education, health and living standards. The econometric analysis, conducted using an instrumental variable probit model, reveals that agricultural diversification significantly reduces the risk of multidimensional poverty by 4.6 percentage points. The results show that households that practice greater diversification are more resilient to economic and climate shocks, with better access to food, income, and essential services. The study further highlights that deprivation in terms of modern energy use, household goods and education contributes most to rural poverty. These findings underscore the importance of promoting diversified agricultural systems, improving market access and addressing structural barriers in order to improve rural well-being. The study provides essential information for the design of integrated and inclusive agricultural policies aligned with national development goals and global poverty reduction programmes.

AB  - Nigeria is a country of over 200 Million people where agriculture plays an important role in maintaining food security and employs about 75% of the population (who are mostly in the rural areas). Like other developing countries, Nigeria faces many challenges affecting its food production potential. This is due, among others, to: the abandonment of agricultural sector because of oil boom in late 1960s; the lack of modern farming implements; the low value addition due to an ineffective value chain that places low priority on value addition which is the fastest growing phase of agricultural value chains in developing countries; and lately the insurgency in the North Eastern part of the country. Among these factors, the emerging effects of climate change have not only affected crop production, but also have contributed significantly to the emerging threats to livestock due to temperature increases, as is evident with the shrinking of Lake Chad which has caused millions of people to lose their major source of livelihood (fishing). This chapter examines the impacts of these factors on the Nigerian agricultural sector and makes some recommendations to policy makers within the perspective of revamping the agricultural sector for a better agricultural delivery and achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. Finally, this chapter reviews some of the governmental efforts to revamp the agricultural sector and rural development programmes in Nigeria to make the sector attractive to the teeming number of youths.

AB  - Highlights Social and technical interventions related to agriculture, watersheds, and capacity building should enhance women’s awareness, access, and decision-making role in agrarian communities. Strict gender norms and relations hinder the empowerment of women in the Bundelkhand region and prevent women from participating in the decision-making process at the household, farm, and community level. When implementing watershed projects in a highly patriarchal context, as in the Bundelkhand region, advocacy of behavioral change communication must be implemented, addressing the diverse needs of women and men. Strengthening of systematic and gender-sensitive institution building, social engagement, and capacity development for global water security is needed for sustainable watershed interventions. ABSTRACT. This study examined gender perspectives on water security by exploring an integrated water management approach for agriculture, livestock, and human consumption. The data were generated in a watershed project to enhance drought resilience of farming through groundwater recharge and agroforestry interventions in the water-scarce Bundelkhand region of Uttar Pradesh in central India. Post-intervention, a quantitative survey and qualitative gender and social analysis tools were applied to understand the benefits of the interventions for women, men, and the community as a whole. Quantitative data were collected from 700 individuals in five villages (three treatment villages and two villages where watershed interventions were not implemented). In addition, 33 semi-structured interviews and eight focus group discussions were conducted to understand local gender norms at the project sites. Data analysis revealed that the community benefits accrued from the watershed interventions included increased crop productivity and diversification of agriculture and livelihoods. However, strict patriarchal norms restricted the visibility, mobility, and communication of women within the household and community during the interventions. Considering gender diversity, this study identifies that women can benefit from participating in watershed interventions and provides a deeper understanding of the constraints and barriers to women’s participation in such projects, including economic, social, and cultural factors. The construction of check dams reduced women’s time per day for fetching water by about 29%. Groundwater level increases reduced the effort required of women to draw water from open wells and hand pumps. Female education is a significant factor related to the benefits of watershed interventions, and regression analysis indicated that households with higher levels of education of adult women were significantly more likely to benefit from the interventions than other households. To avoid perpetuation of the exclusion of diverse local knowledge and gender inequality at the community level, mechanisms must be developed and adjusted continuously such that whole communities, including men and women, are empowered to participate in the decision-making process at various levels and for different purposes. When implementing watershed projects in a highly patriarchal context, as in the Bundelkhand region where women are hidden behind the strong presence of men, advocacy of behavioral change communication must be implemented regularly. The community needs to be sensitized toward systematic and gender-sensitive institution building, social engagement, and capacity development for local as well as global water security.

AB  - Purpose Laser land leveling (LLL) is a climate-smart technology that improves water use efficiency and reduces risk in crop cultivation due to weather variability. Hence, this technology is useful for cultivating water-intensive crops in a sustainable way. Given this background, the state government of Karnataka initiated to promote LLL in drought-prone districts and selected Raichur district for implementation. Moreover, farmers in this district had observed drought situation during monsoon paddy growing season in 2018. Therefore, this study attempts to investigate the importance of LLL technology for paddy cultivation under drought conditions. Design/methodology/approach A primary survey with 604 farmer households had been conducted in Raichur in 2018. Among them, 50% are adopters of LLL who have been selected purposively and rest 50% are non-adopters who have grown paddy in the adjacent or nearest plot of the laser-leveled plot. The adoption and causal impact of LLL has been estimated using propensity score matching, coarsened exact matching and endogenous switching regression methods. Findings The result reveals a positive and significant impact of LLL on paddy yield and net returns to the farmers. The results indicate an increment of 12 and 16% in rice yield and net income, respectively, for LLL adopters in comparison to the non-adopters of LLL. Research limitations/implications The major limitation of the study is that it does not adopt the method of experimental study due to certain limitations; hence, the authors employed a quasi-experimental method to look at the possible impact of adoption of LL. Originality/value There have been various agronomic studies focusing on the ex-ante assessment of the LLL. This study is an ex-post assessment of the technology on the crop yield and farmers' income in a dry semi-arid region of India, which, according to the authors, is the first in this approach.

AB  - We assess the impact of community-based approaches to promote adoption of integrated climate smart agriculture (CSA) practices based on soybean cultivation combined with mulching, intercropping, crop rotation, manure application and rhizobium inoculation methods. We use quasi-experimental data of farmers participating in Farmer Field Business Schools (FFBS) and Village Savings and Loan Associations (VSLAs) in Iringa region of Tanzania. Farmers received technical training and financial support for the initial adoption of soybean production, and women's empowerment supported household's continuous involvement in CSA practices. We find a positive effect for farmers participating in the trainings provided by the FFBSs and receiving microfinance services from VLSA members on the adoption rates of several CSA practices, and this effect became more pronounced for households with higher scores on women empowerment. Farm-level improvement in soybean production and market-level incentives for soybean sales should also strengthen household income, consumption and nutrition levels to maintain CSA practices. Community-based platforms create critical external conditions for introducing CSA practices, but women's empowerment is indispensable for intrinsic incentives for anchoring their adoption.

AB  - The study was conducted during 2018/19 production season in four purposively selected kebeles in Debub Omo Zone. The main objective of this study was to evaluate and introduce the improved finger millet technology at farmers' condition in the areas. A total of 20 participant farmers were selected purposively. Individual interview by using likert scale, farmers' research and extension group discussion and weight measurements tools were used to collect all necessary data. Simple descriptive statistics such mean and percentages were used to analysis quantitative data and three point likert-scale ranking was used to rank farmers' preferences data. Based on the pre-selected farmers' evaluation criteria, the field performances evaluation of improved finger millet variety was showed better field performances in drought tolerance, resistance to logging and diseases, spike length and plant height over the local cultivator. The yield performances of the improved variety under both farmers' management condition and on FTCs managed by researchers were 6.73% and 18.8% of yield advantage respectively over the local cultivator. Therefore, introducing the improved finger millet technologies at large scale enhances its adoption rate and increase productivity of finger millet in the vicinities and areas with similar agro-ecologies.

AB  - Several technologies have been developed to improve the recovery efficiency of N (REN) but their impacts on greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, N loss and economic implication are rarely analysed. A decision support system (DSS) has been developed to quantify inputs, outputs and balance of N in soil; GHG emission and REN with the prominent N management technologies in rice. This DSS, named InfoNitro (Information on Nitrogen Management Technologies in Rice), integrated analytical and expert knowledge with databases on bio-physical, agronomic and socio-economical features to establish input–output relationships related to N management in rice. Sixteen technologies, which differed in terms of water regime, method of N application, forms of N and tools of fertilizer recommendation were analysed for their REN, N losses, GHG emission and economic return in Haryana, a rice growing region in India. In the current farmers’ practice, REN was 32.7%, which increased up to 40.8% with various technologies except in mid-season drainage and alternate flooding technologies where it decreased up to 29.3%. Loss of N through leaching, volatilization and denitrification in the farmers’ practice (67.5&nbsp;kg&nbsp;N&nbsp;ha−1) decreased up to 40.5&nbsp;kg&nbsp;N&nbsp;ha−1 except in mid-season drainage and alternate flooding technologies where it increased. The technologies also reduced global warming potential (GWP) by 1 to 9%. However, the technologies except no tillage, mid-season drying and alternate flooding reduced the net income of the farmers. When the environmental cost (cost of N loss and GWP) was included net income with various technologies was either at par or more than the farmers’ practice. The marginal abatement cost of N loss was Rs. 8 to 134&nbsp;kg−1 N and for GWP was Rs. 766 to 4854&nbsp;Mg−1 CO2 eq. Resource conserving technology was the most cost effective strategy to reduce N loss and GHG emission whereas integrated N management cost high for mitigating GHG emission.

AB  - Small-scale sector fisheries associated with tropical wetland were found to be highly vulnerable to various socio-economic, ecological and climatic factors. The present study conducted in Vembanad lake in India attempted to identify and assess vulnerabilities of wetland fishers to climate variability at spatial scale. One hundred and eighty fishers distributed across three villages (Vaikkom, Muhamma and Thycattussery) who were representative of marine, freshwater and brackish water fishers, respectively, were surveyed based on a structured schedule prepared by National Innovations for Climate Resilient Agriculture and ICAR-Central Inland Fisheries Research Institute. Potential indicators of vulnerability as perceived from survey were segregated under seven drivers such as health, livelihood, social, food, ecological, resource and resource user. These indicators which were represented by attributes were scored, based on fishers’ perception, and were used for identifying the highly contributing drivers of vulnerabilities. Kruskal–Wallis parametric test was used for analyzing the vulnerabilities statistically. The overall wetland vulnerability indices derived from various villages indicated that Thycattussery was highly vulnerable compared to Muhamma and Vaikkom. A transactional analysis across each sampling station indicated that in Vaikkom, fishers were less vulnerable to resource, food security and resource user vulnerabilities in a climate changing context. Poor status of livelihood, social and food related insecurities and resource user-based uncertainties were the factors attributing to fishers' vulnerability in Thycattussery. The fishers of Muhamma experienced greater ecological and resource-based vulnerabilities. The study suggested that a bottom-up approach involving the primary stakeholders (fishers) along with the community will adequately position them to climate change adaptation and mitigation.

AB  - Abstract Scientists increasingly draw on fishers' ecological knowledge (FEK) to gain a better understanding of fish biology and ecology, and inform options for fisheries management. We report on a study of FEK among fishers along the Lower Ucayali River in Peru, a region of exceptional productivity and diversity, which is also a major supplier of fish to the largest city in the Peruvian Amazon. Given a lack of available scientific information on stock status, we sought to identify temporal changes in the composition and size of exploited species by interviewing fishers from 18 communities who vary in years of fishing experience since the mid‐1950s. We develop four FEK‐based indicators to assess changes in the fish assemblage and compare findings with landings data. We find an intensification of fishing gear deployed over time and spatiotemporal shifts in the fish assemblage and reported declines in species weight, which point to a fishing‐down process with declines across multiple species. This finding is reflected in a shifting baseline among our participants, whereby younger generations of fishers have different expectations regarding the distribution and size of species. Our study points to the importance of spillover effects from the nearby Pacaya‐Samira National Reserve and community initiatives to support the regional fishery. Reference to fishers' knowledge also suggests that species decline is likely underreported in aggregated landings data. Despite the dynamism and diversity of Amazonian floodplain fisheries, simple FEK‐based indicators can provide useful information for understanding fishing‐induced changes in the fish assemblage. Fishers hold valuable knowledge for fishery management and conservation initiatives in the region.

AB  - Societal Impact Statement The production and availability of food underpins societal stability. In Afghanistan, wheat is the major arable agricultural crop and source of dietary energy. The withdrawal of NATO allies and partner countries from Afghanistan presents numerous well‐documented societal and political challenges and has impacts on immediate and longer‐term food security. Conflict‐impacted irrigation infrastructure coupled with growing climate instability have also contributed markedly to reductions in current food, and specifically wheat, production. Here, we review the status of Afghan wheat improvement and propose a research agenda to support the regeneration of Afghanistan's wheat and agricultural sector. Summary Afghanistan is a country with diverse natural ecologies in a largely arid and mountainous region. The rural sector is still considered to drive economic potential. Current social, political and economic instability along with climatic challenges are driving food and water insecurity in the wider region. In the short term, it is likely that this and the associated challenges of displacement and unemployment can only be addressed by humanitarian intervention and agrifood and nutrition support. In the medium to long term, drought, and heat, probably linked to climate change, will pose recurrent challenges for agriculture and food security that will require a much broader set of interventions to secure the rural population's livelihoods. The genetic gap, among other major challenges, must be addressed if Afghanistan is to develop its agricultural potential leading to income and livelihood improvements for farmers and stable and accessible supplies for consumers. Only thereby will the country be enabled to reap the important and long‐sought trade and food security benefits derived from self‐sufficiency. Here, we highlight the agricultural challenges facing Afghanistan and propose forward strategies for ensuring the future stability of wheat production, the cornerstone of Afghan agriculture.

AB  - The study was conducted in the Butana region of Sudan to assess the impact of climate change on the browse trees/shrubs cover and production in the Butana rangelands. Five meteorological stations surrounding Butana were selected to represent the region's climate. Simple regression analysis was used to analyze the trend of climate variables (rainfall, temperature). The direct count method was used to measure browse production and a social survey was also conducted to assess farmers' perceptions on climate change. Rainfall for all meteorological stations showed a decrease in monthly and annual rainfall during 1961-2013. Annual temperature analysis indicated a noticeable increase in maximum and minimum rates at all meteorological stations since 1985. All interviewees agreed that trees/shrubs cover had decreased compared to the past. Significant differences (P&lt; 0.05) were found in browse production between the sites during the dry (No rainfall) season. The average browse production of three sites was 310, 236, and 297kg/ha for the wet season and 247, 95, and 85 kg/ha in the dry season for El-Idaidat, El-Bahoogi, and Wad-Shamoon sites, respectively. The variation in browse production between sites was linked with tree density/ha, which was directly affected by decreasing in rainfall and increased temperatures. Seed banks in Ewerdaidat were 4 seeds/m2 while 3 seeds/m2 were found at El-Bahoogi. The study concluded that there was a decrease in rainfall and an increase in temperature during the last decade in the Butana, reflected negatively on trees/shrubs cover and its browse productivity.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the productive economic performance and greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in typical cow-calf farms in the Flooding Pampas, Argentina. A dynamic, bio-economic and environmental "whole-farm" model (SIMUGAN) and regional data were used to evaluate two contrasting scenarios obtained from the 4 systems identified in a previous study. Two scenarios were taken as baseline: medium-scale traditional farmer (Tr) and large-scale local technified enterprise (Te). Both scenarios were intensified with the inclusion of two levels of fescue pasture under good management practices (5 or 10% of the farm area), and the anticipation of the first service of heifers (from 27 to 15 months age) for the scenarios with 10% of fescue pasture. The GHG intensity emissions (IE) varied accordingly to the intensification level in a similar trend for Tr and Te scenarios (between 16.4 and 19.9 kg CO2 eq kg LW-1). The additive effect for the 10% of fescue pasture incorporation combined with early mating of heifers reduced IE up to 17%. Results suggest that it is feasible to reduce IE by the adoption of available technologies. Although further experimental research is required, this study provides useful information about GHG for policy makers and farmers in order to promote a higher promotion/adoption of technologies based on their economic response.

AB  - To understand the responses of fish production to both fishing pressure and climate variability in the northern South China Sea (NSCS), catch time series are partitioned into interannual trends and variations. These are separately related to growth in fishing effort and physical variables. Catches of the fishery underwent dome-shaped trends corresponding to a monotonic growth in fishing effort, first in the inshore and then in the offshore demersal fishes, while total catch and catches of the low-trophic species showed a rising trend until 1990, and eventually experienced a decline under high fishing pressure. After accounting for the trends from the growth in fishing pressure, variations in catches were lag correlated with land precipitation, monsoon wind speeds, and a proposed index of tropical cyclone influence. The linkage suggests that river runoff, monsoon circulation and tropical cyclone impacts are the physical forcing factors dominating the catch variations, and the effects are largely through controlling the nutrient supply for biological production. Runoff provides nutrients to the inshore waters, while monsoons and tropical cyclones control the distribution and availability of nutrients. The winter monsoon increases primary production and hence fish production by offshore diffusion of the nitrogen-rich riverine water masses and by enhancing vertical mixing. In contrast, the summer monsoon reduces availability of nutrients for biological production by confining the distribution of the riverine water masses and strengthening water column stratification. Tropical cyclones are a strong forcing factor that has a positive effect on production of fishes. Tropical cyclones mobilize nutrient elements and enhance biological production by increasing water circulation, wind mixing and upwelling, and by inducing heavy rainfall and territory runoff. Based on the suggested physical forcing factors and their controlling mechanisms, the analysis predicts that increasing anthropogenic nutrient inputs and future climate changes are likely to result in an increase in fish production in the NSCS; this may be associated with even larger interannual and interdecadal fluctuations in fish production.

AB  - Rice in Myanmar is grown in diverse environments, including inland dry zone and salt-affected coastal deltas. This study evaluated management options that could improve productivity and reduce risks of rice crop in stress-prone areas of the country. We selected four sites from two regions in the central dry zone (Wundwin) and the Ayeyarwady delta (Labutta, Bogale and Mawlamyinegyun). We used experimental and survey datasets on farmers’ practices and rice yields from 2012 to 2014 to run the ORYZA model to simulate the climatic yield potential (YP; yield without stress) and the attainable yield under rainfed conditions (YW; yield limited by water), saline conditions (YS; yield limited by salinity), and under conditions of current farmers’ practices (YF; yield in farmers’ practices). Simulated yield responses to different management practices showed spatial variability within and among the selected sites. YP ranged from 5.4 to 11.1 t ha−1, YW ranged from 0.5 to 7.5 t ha−1, and YF ranged from 2.2 to 4.2 t ha−1. In salt-affected areas, average YS ranged from less than 0.1 t ha-1 to 5.6 t ha−1. Yield gains with the choice of an improved variety and adjusted sowing date were estimated at up to 53% above YF. Changing the time of sowing and using improved rice varieties provided the greatest yield gains in salt-affected and drought-prone areas where YF was the least. In areas where YF was greater, the improvement of nitrogen management provided larger benefits than in areas with lower YF. We conclude that an integrated approach using remote-sensing technologies, crop modeling, and a geographic information system is valuable for targeting the best management options to close the yield gap in unfavorable rice environments in Asia.

AB  - Coordination among the different stakeholders at policy planning, implementation and target beneficiary level, particularly among the agencies responsible for development and management of water resources, agriculture and fisheries, is essential for overall sustainable development. Stocking of larger fingerlings at suitable stocking densities of endemic (rohu, catla, mrigal) and exotic (silver carp, bighead carp, common carp/mirror carp) species should be stocked at varying proportion. Floodplain fish production depends only on the natural fertility of the water bodies. Technological interventions should include the installation of low cost bamboo fencing at water inlet and outlet points and setting of ring culverts for maintaining suitable levels of water for fish culture without hampering the production of rice and other crops in the intervention areas, selective stocking with native and exotic carps, restricted fishing for certain period of time and guarding. It is expected to exert positive influences in enhancing the standing crop and biodiversity of non-stocked species of fishes in the intervention seasonal floodplain. Entry of fish larvae, hatchlings and young fry of wild non-stocked fishes into the seasonal floodplains because of large fence spacing (approximately 1.0 cm), could restrict fishing for certain period, undisturbed habitat and guarding could contribute to higher productivity and enhancement of fish biodiversity in the seasonal floodplains. Proper motivation and effective cooperation of the beneficiaries are extremely important to culture fish in the seasonal floodplains under community based management system. Institutional support and constant vigilance from the Department of Fisheries (DoF) and local administrations are indispensable to ensure the sustainability of fish culture initiatives in the seasonal floodplains. Active participation and involvement of the local community people in all stages of fish culture operation beginning from selection of floodplains, formation of floodplain management committee, planning of fish culture activities, exercise of technical intervention, selective stocking with large fingerlings, guarding, monitoring and supervision, adopting harvesting strategies, marketing and distribution of benefits are extremely essential to ensure sustainability of the program. Mutual trust, sense of respect and good working relationship among the committee members are the basic social elements required for the success of community based fish culture initiatives.

AB  - This study focuses on identifying critical environmental hazardous factors (CEHFs), threatening health and production of dairy production system in Pakistan under climate change scenario. Expert Judgment approach is employed to identify and then rank most significant CEHFs that are related to emerging security hazards to dairy system. These CEHFs are then stitched with existing body of literature to consolidate our findings. Results comprised key CEHFs affecting occurrence of security hazards to dairy production in the scenario of changing climate. Experts ranked lack of genetic research and fodder security on top among various critical factors that drive and increase occurrence of security hazards to health and production of dairy animals. Lack of labs to identify diseases, sensitiveness of buffaloes to temperature, slow and reduced weight gain and effect on birth and death rate are weighted high as threat to farm animal health while India-Pakistan ties on water, water scarcity, high water requirement for buffaloes and lack of innovation in processing of milk and milk products are other major threats to production from farm animals. The findings of this study can serve as basis of providing key elements for policy devising in order to have research based policy making and implementation with separate set of policy actions for small, medium and large farmers. Input price mechanism, regularization of dairy sector, separate policy measures for meat and dairy animals and preservation of local breeds are few optimistic policy options to safeguard Pakistan’s dairy production system from environmental factor under climate change.

AB  - This study identifies the livelihood characteristics of small-scale fishers and how their livelihoods become affected through climate change-induced events, based on fieldwork in four fishing communities in lower Padma hilsa (Tenualosa ilisha) sanctuaries. To collect empirical data, several qualitative tools were employed, such as individual interviews, focus group discussions, oral history, and key informant interviews. A conceptual framework named Sustainable Livelihood Approaches (SLA) was used to analyze the data. The insights of the livelihood and climate vulnerability of small-scale fishers and fisheries management were addressed. The factors related to climate change included fluctuation of temperature and rainfall, frequent natural calamities, tidal inundation and outbreak of diseases. In addition, river pollution, alteration of migratory routes, poverty, malnutrition, debt cycle, social tension, stakeholder conflicts and lack of alternative earning flexibility made them more vulnerable. The current findings, derived from fishers' perceptions, are crucial for sanctuary's co-management, biodiversity conservation, planning and development of livelihoods of the smallscale fishers.

AB  - Excessive fossil fuel consumption has increased the greenhouse gases (GHG)s effect, and provoked climate change in recent decades. The agricultural industry, one of the major consumers of this energy type, highly contributes to the existing challenges. Applying solar energy technologies (SETs) in this industry can lead to the development of green energies and reduce existing problems. Structural equation modeling (SEM) is adopted to assess the factors influencing farmers' intention to utilize SETs. A researcher-devised questionnaire is distributed among 594 farmers in Tehran Province, Iran, and the obtained data is analyzed through AMOS (version 26) software package. The results revealed the positive and significant effects of attitude, awareness, self-efficacy, trust in technology, performance expectancy, and facilitating conditions on usage intention; thus, 57.4% predicted usage intention of SETs. The distance from the power grids (DPG)s moderates the correlation between 1) trust in technology and usage intention,2) the correlation between attitude and usage intention, and 3) facilitating conditions and trust in technology. Attitude partially mediated the correlation between variables (except self-efficacy) and usage intention. In addition to the theoretical implications, this study can assist the policymakers in defining policies for developing renewable energies (RE)s, especially solar, in developing countries.

AB  - This paper seeks to uncover the impact of negative rainfall shocks on household social network relationships. I leverage the uncertainty generated from fluctuating long-term rainfall patterns across India, to estimate the impact of heightened climate risks on investments in social network relationships. In so doing, I attempt to disentangle the “direct” and “adaptive” impacts of climate shocks on social network relationships. I found that households that experience higher than average negative rainfall shocks (lower than average rainfall levels over the long term) tend to invest more in family–caste and vertical or linked network relationships. These network relationships were also found to be associated with greater access to financial credit, credit sourced specifically from family members, higher reported collaboration, more diversified businesses, and the use of private irrigation technologies, all of which are key to mitigating the negative impacts of climate shocks. Unlike past research, these results suggest that households’ decisions to invest in social networks may be an adaptive response to higher climate risk. In terms of policy implications, these results highlight the importance of strengthening and supporting family-based and linked networks (such as links to local governmental agencies and extension services) in the face of higher climate risks.

AB  - Identification of potential flood risk areas is crucial to reduce flood damage for the frequently flooded and low-lying South Asian developing countries. The present study has prepared district-level (District: second administrative unit of the country) flood risk map for the flood-prone Rangpur Division (Division: first administrative unit) of Bangladesh using the multi-criteria decision analysis along with the application of analytical hierarchy process (AHP) method. Eight physical factors such as elevation, slope, distance from river, drainage density, land cover, rainfall, height above nearest drainage (HAND), and topographic wetness index (TWI), and six social factors such as population density, dependent population, disabled population, female population, agriculture dependent population, and literacy have been assessed to create a final risk map. The flood risk map is divided into five risk zones: very low, low, moderate, high, and very high. Integration of the social factors along with the physical factors reflects the insight of the vulnerability and increases the authenticity of the generated risk map. This study found that 62.46% area of the Rangpur Division resides under the moderate to very high-risk zone of flooding. Using ROC (receiver operating characteristic)-AUC (area under the curve) curve, the risk map is validated with a score of 0.83 from the flood inventory map of 2020 generated from the Sentinel 1 image. This risk map will guide policymakers to easily identify the vulnerable area for flood hazards and suitable areas for development activities necessary to attain sustainable development.

AB  - Assessments of “resilience” are becoming a priority across multiple sectors. Specifically, the coastal agricultural system in Bangladesh faces a multitude of problems such as sea level rise. Building resilience for this system is thus important in accelerating the country’s socio-economic development. Therefore, the objectives of this study are (a) to assess resilience of coastal agricultural systems and (b) to develop coastal agroecosystem stewardship strategies in Bangladesh. Resilience was assessed quantitatively, based on an established framework that includes three capacities (i.e., absorptive, adaptive and transformative) and five dimensions, namely, social, economic, ecological, physical and institutional. Fifteen indicators were developed by applying an assemblage of top-down and bottom-up approaches. A structured questionnaire was used to survey 330 households from 15 villages in five coastal sub-districts. The percentile value of composite resilience indices revealed that one-fifths of the coastal farmers (or households) had a mixed ability (e.g., fish farming skills) and capacity (e.g., better decision-making) to recover, reorganise and evolve following shocks (e.g., flash flood) and stresses (e.g., water logging). Following resilience assessment, five coastal agroecosystem stewardship strategies (facilitating adaptive agricultural governance; promoting economic and ecological diversity; fostering social learning; investing in coastal infrastructure; and increasing agricultural productivity) are developed based on principal component analysis. The methods of objectively developing stewardship strategies can be replicable to other coastal areas. The findings of this study are intended to be used for contributing to coastal adaptation planning in Bangladesh, especially for the Delta Plan 2100.

AB  - Abstract The Sundarbans, the largest mangrove forest in the world, has been undergoing significant ecological changes due to climate change-related weather events since the late 1990s. This forest, situated in south-west Bangladesh, provides livelihood services to 3.5 million people. The livelihood provision of the Sundarbans forest has been invented due to climate-induced disasters, such as cyclones, sea-level rise, salinisation, heat waves, and flooding. Considering the impacts of cyclones Aila and Sidr, this autoethnographic study closely examines the long-established perceptions of women and men about the resources of the Sundarbans. While doing so, this study uses feminist political ecology as a theoretical framework. This study examines how these two cyclones transformed lives and gendered livelihoods of the villagers of Shora in the Sundarbans forest.

AB  - The food-health-poverty nexus and the challenges of addressing this connection are well recognized, yet there is insufficient research to understand the complexity of local situations that would provide necessary information on where and how to intervene to make progress on the interconnected SDGs for health (SDG 3) and food security (SDG 2). This chapter reports on qualitative research conducted in small-scale farming communities in the Rushebeya Wetlands and adjacent areas in Rukiga District in western Uganda. It revealed the interconnected pathways of how climate variability, suboptimal farming practices and population stress contribute to environmental degradation, highlighting in particular how women who are reliant on environmentally dependent livelihoods face heightened risks in the absence of access to family planning services, impacting their health and nutritional well-being. These vulnerabilities underscore the urgent need to move towards cross-sectoral programming that acknowledges the interconnected challenges posed by demographic pressures, ecosystems, livelihoods, and health.

AB  - Background: Floods are among the deadliest natural calamities, devastating ecosystems and human lives worldwide. In India, Bihar is a state grappling with economic hardships and faces severe agricultural devastation due to recurring floods, destroying crops and natural resources, which significantly impacts local farmers. This research addresses the critical need to deeply understand the flood dynamics of selected study areas. Objective: This research presents a case study that focuses on leveraging Remote Sensing tools and Machine Learning techniques for comprehensive flood mapping and damage analysis in Gopalganj District, Bihar, India, using remote sensing data. More specifically, this research presents three major objectives: (i) Flood damage mapping and change analysis before and after the flood using the Sentinel-2 satellite dataset, (ii) Evaluation of the impact of integrating spectral indices on the accuracy of classification, (iii) Identification of most robust predictor spectral indices for the classification. Methods: The Sentinel-2 satellite dataset encompasses 13 bands with resolutions of 10m, 20m, and 60m. Here, four spectral bands (NIR, Red, Green, and Blue) with the finest resolution of 10m have been selected for this study. These bands are integrated with four spectral indices, namely Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), MNDWI (Modified NDWI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI). Two ML classifiers, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) have been employed for pixel-based supervised classification. Results: Results have shown that RF outperformed and worked well in extracting water bodies and flood-damaged areas effectively. The results demonstrated that RF obtained (Overall Accuracy (OA)= 89.54% and kappa value (ka) = 0.872) and SVM reported (OA= 87.69%, ka= 0.849) for pre-crisis data, whereas, for post-crisis, RF reported (OA=91.54%, ka = 0.897), SVM reported (OA= 89.77%, ka= 0.875). Conclusion: It was reported that the integration of spectral indices improved the OA by +3.41% and +2.86% using RF and SVM, respectively. The results of this study demonstrated that the waterbody area increased from 12.72 to 88.23 km2, as shown by the RF classifier. The variable importance computation results indicated that MNDWI is the most important predictor variable, followed by NDWI. This study recommends the use of these two predictor variables for flood mapping.

AB  - Viral diseases pose a significant threat to Bangladesh’s livestock sector, resulting in substantial economic losses and impeding overall growth. These infections disrupt animal productivity, undermine food security, and place financial strain on farmers. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the major viral diseases impacting livestock in Bangladesh. The cumulative burden of viral diseases jeopardizes a sector that contributes 1.54% to the national GDP. Factors such as uncontrolled animal movement and trade, along with climate change, exacerbate disease transmission and increase the risk of outbreaks. The economic repercussions extend beyond production losses to include rising food prices and serious public health concerns stemming from zoonotic transmission and antimicrobial resistance. Effective mitigation requires integrated control strategies, including widespread vaccination, strengthened biosecurity, and robust disease surveillance. Enhancing veterinary infrastructure and aligning with international disease control standards will improve market access and ensure sector sustainability. Long‐term resilience will depend on coordinated efforts among government agencies, private stakeholders, and international partners to safeguard food security and rural livelihoods.

AB  - Four decades after the construction of the Sobradinho Dam, the consequences associated with the modification of the course of the San Francisco River can be verified through the environmental impacts on the use of the land: the cultivation of rice through flooding has changed to cultivation in "Irrigated Perimeters" in the San Francisco Sergipano Low Valley.Currently, the shortage of agricultural technicians, water distribution in the crops along with the increase in rat plagues, and fish farming in the irrigated perimeters are some of the consequences that have brought about economic losses for the farmers, in addition to the potential loss of traditional rice cultivation in the valley.This article is a case study which compares the characteristics between traditional and current models in the use of land and production systems, the advantages and disadvantages of the Irrigated Perimeters and the restoration strategies for this area.A tendency to return to traditional agricultural work both with and without the help of technology was discovered in this study.Future prospects for sustainable development depend on government action taken with respect to the San Francisco River.

AB  - The livelihoods of the fishing communities residing in the geographically vulnerable coastal zone are constantly threatened by escalating coastal disasters. The communities face persistent challenges, including livelihood failure, poverty, high exposure and sensitivity, and lower adaptive capacity, yet little attention has been paid to comprehending their multifaceted livelihood vulnerabilities amid climate-induced disasters. This study bridges that gap by employing several techniques to address the challenge. It adopts a mixed-method analysis and investigates the Livelihood Assessment Index (LAI), Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI), and Climate Vulnerability Index (CVI) to assess the livelihood vulnerability of fishing communities residing in the new and old fishery ghats (riverside locations where fishing-related activities take place) in Chattogram district in southern Bangladesh. Findings reveal that the fishing communities experience higher exposure levels and moderate vulnerability in the face of escalating climate-induced disasters. The overall LAI indicates a relatively low level of livelihood satisfaction, suggesting potential challenges or deficiencies in aspects contributing to well-being. Despite socioeconomic and demographic similarities, as LVI values present, the exposure varies between the two study locations. Both locations are characterized by moderate sensitivity, while the new fishery ghat showed slightly higher adaptive capacity, contributing to greater resilience. The CVI values indicated higher vulnerability for the new fishery ghat fishing community, suggesting increased challenges related to climate-induced threats, and the old ghat community exhibited lower vulnerability, showcasing better resilience to disasters. Factors influencing livelihood vulnerability include limited access to education and healthcare in the new fishery ghat, while the old fishery ghat benefits from better provisions, communication, and social networks. The study advocates for context-specific decision-making and targeted interventions to support vulnerable fishing communities in coastal zones globally, emphasizing the need for improved social safety nets and alternative livelihood options. Addressing these occupational vulnerabilities is crucial for long-term development in climate-risk countries like Bangladesh.

AB  - One of the main instruments of risk management and climate risk reduction in the agricultural sector is the use of climate information services (CIS). Meteorological information can be useful for society by increasing the efficiency of resource consumption and helping to improve decision-making management. However, there is a gap between the production and implementation of weather forecasts, and that is the lack of practical use of weather forecasts in the agricultural decision-making process. In doing so, this research was conducted with the main objective of identifying components influencing the utilize of CIS by farmers in southwest Iran. The research utilized social cognitive theory (SCT) as the underlying framework, employing a survey method and employing Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) for analysis. The research encompassed all farmers residing in Dezful city within the Khuzestan province, located in the southwest of Iran. The results showed that the variables of SCT, namely outcome expectations, perception of others’ behavior, self-efficacy, socio-structural, and behavioral intentions are very powerful in identifying factors affecting farmers’ use of CIS and can account for 76.4% of the variance of farmers’ behavior. Therefore, these research results can provide essential help to authorities to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change on agriculture.

AB  - A crop yield prediction is critical to increase agricultural sustainability because it allows for the more effective use of natural resources, including water, fertilizers, and soil. Accurate yield estimates enable farmers and governments to more accurately manage resources, decreasing waste and minimizing adverse environmental effects such as the degradation of soil and water quality issues. In addition, predictive models serve to alleviate the consequences of climate change by promoting adaptable farming techniques and improving the availability of food by means of early decision-making. Thus, including a crop yield prediction into farming practices is critical for combining productivity and sustainability. In contrast to conventional machine learning models, which frequently require long feature engineering, deep learning may obtain complicated yield-related characteristics directly from initial or merely preprocessed data from different sources. This research paper aims to demonstrate the strength of deep learning models and their ensembles in agricultural yield prediction in Saudi Arabia, where agriculture faces issues such as scarce water resources and harsh climate conditions. We first define and evaluate a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as baseline deep models for the crop yield prediction. Then, we investigate combining these three models based on stacking, blending, and boosting ensemble methods. Finally, we study the uncertainty quantification for the proposed models, which involves a discussion of many enhancements’ techniques. As a result, this research shows that, by applying the right architectures with strong parametrization and optimization techniques, we obtain models that can explain 96% of the variance in the crop yield with a very low uncertainty rate (reaching an MPIW of 0.60), which proves the reliability and trustworthiness of the prediction.

AB  - Malawi is a land-locked country in southern Africa. Three-fourths of Malawi’s 13 million people rely on smallholder agriculture for their livelihoods. Increasing population, accelerating deforestation, poor soil and water management, and increasing poverty and land degradation directly impact the food security and human health of millions of Malawians. Cropping systems which combine cereal crops, agroforestry and small doses of inorganic fertilizers produce food-crop yields greater than inorganic fertilizers alone on degraded soils, as well as recuperating soil nutrients over a period of years. These agroforestry practices improve the livelihoods of farm families, lower risks associated with fertilizer price increases and drought and at the same time improve biodiversity and nutrient and water cycling in the agro-ecosystem. The World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF) has a long history of agroforestry research and development in Malawi dating back to the 1980s. In 2007-2011, ICRAF implemented the Malawi Agroforestry Food Security Project (AFSP) through financial support from Irish Aid. ICRAF’s task in AFSP was to build a strong partnership to reach 200,000 farming families in 11 districts. The purpose of AFSP was to combine tested agroforestry practices, effective partnership and informed policies to increase food security and income, and improve livelihood opportunities for rural communities in Malawi, through accelerated adoption of fertilizer trees, fruit trees, fodder trees and fuel-wood trees. To accomplish these purposes, ICRAF provided the farming communities with planting material (tree seeds and seedlings), and the knowledge of how to care for them and effectively combine them with food crops. The beneficiaries of the project saw increases in household food security and nutrition. However, difficulties were encountered in transporting tree seeds and seedlings across eleven districts in a timely fashion, and in managing the flow of reporting and disbursements of funding among such a large group of collaborators. Several solutions were implemented which improved performance in these areas, and which allowed the group to reach very near the targeted number of participants, and to plan for a second phase of the project.

AB  - This study aimed to assess the influence of the high biodiversity silvopastoral system (SPSnu) on the microclimate, pasture production, and pasture chemical composition. Microclimate variables and pasture production and chemical composition were measured in pared paddocks under SPSnu and treeless pasture (TLP) in a commercial farm during four seasons in Southern Brazil. SPSnu measurements were subdivided into two areas: around the nuclei (AN) and area inter-nuclei (IN). In the TLP paddocks, we plotted fictitious nuclei with the same areas and distributions of SPSnu, however without trees. For the microclimate measurements, these areas were noted when shaded or unshaded by the nuclei trees. In each season, the microclimate variables air temperature (AT, °C), relative humidity (RH, %), illuminance (Ilu, lux), wind speed (WS, m/s), and soil surface temperature (SST, °C) were measured. In addition, botanical composition (%), pasture production (kg/DM/ ha), and pasture chemical composition were evaluated. The SPSnu provided the lowest values of microclimate variables in all seasons (p &lt; 0.05), except for the relative humidity. Winter had the highest thermal amplitude in the systems. The highest difference between SPSnu and TLP for AT (4.3&nbsp;°C) and SST (5.2&nbsp;°C) was measured during the hot seasons (spring and summer). In contrast, during cold seasons (autumn and winter) it observed highest thermal amplitude between SPSnu and TLP. Overall, the highest annual pasture production was observed in the SPSnu (p &lt; 0.05). During the summer, the SPSnu areas showed the highest values of crude protein and dry matter (p &lt; 0.05). During the winter, the TLP showed the lowest values (p &lt; 0.05) of pasture production and dry matter. It was observed that SPSnu improved the microclimate at the pasture level, influencing pasture production and pasture chemical composition. The enhanced microclimate can partially mitigate some of the effects of climate change on pastoral agroecosystems, creating conditions for ecological rehabilitation of ecosystem processes and services. These conditions could be amplified to a biome level through a payment for ecosystem services program.

AB  - Increasing frequencies of climate change-induced extreme weather events like prolonged droughts pose significant challenges for small-scale subsistence farmers in sub-Saharan Africa, who rely on the yearly harvest by more than 80 % of their nutritional needs. However, we do not have a good understanding of yield estimates at the field and household level (with a mean field size of < 2 ha) to understand nutritional priorities in vulnerable communities due to their scarcity in the literature, particularly yield estimates that do not require re-collection of in-situ data. Statistical models for estimating regional food crop yields based on high-resolution satellite data at the field level may provide better insights into how to address health risks such as child malnutrition. Especially in low-resource contexts, where the burden is greatest and expected to worsen in future climate projections. Our study developed crop-specific, satellite-based yield models using a novel three-year data set of in-situ yield measurements as exemplified for a rural region in Burkina Faso. The aim of the model is to reduce the need for in-situ field data collection while still assuring accurate yield estimates at the field level. The model employed LASSO regression and was based on monthly vegetation index composites from Sentinel-2 and weekly accumulated Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS) rainfall data. Our yield modeling results showed that there was less overfitting when there was more training data over three years that demonstrated a wider range of yields, which also led to better model fits. R² values ranged from 0.62 (Maize) to 0.3 (Sorghum) for the three-year yield models, with normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) values ranging from 12 % − 16 %. An additional plausibility check confirmed the validity of our models, as we compared the magnitude of our yield estimation with national yield statistics for Burkina Faso. We demonstrated that our models based on three years of in-situ data may capture some of the inter-annual variability in yields, which could be a step toward minimizing the necessity for in-situ measurements in the future. Our advances in predicting yield estimates at the field level enable a linkage between household-level yields, socioeconomic indicators, nutritional status of children, and the health status of the household members. A further application is linking high-resolution yield data to farmers’ productivity losses from increasing heat under climate change.

AB  - Abstract Adapting agricultural systems to changes in seasonal precipitation is critical for the agricultural sector in Sri Lanka. This paper presents evidence on the adoption drivers and the welfare impacts of agricultural strategies adopted by Sri Lankan rice farmers to adapt to low rainfall conditions. We estimate the causal impact of adopting different adaptive strategies across three different dimensions: (a) sensitivity to water stress, (b) household productivity, and (c) household livelihood conditions. The results highlight important trade-offs faced by farmers between reducing vulnerability to water stress and maximizing profitability and welfare outcomes. These findings are important for informing policies to support climate adaptation among smallholders, and to build and improve the climate resilience of Sri Lanka's rice sector.

AB  - Increasing climate variability, particularly flooding, severely impacts shrimp production yields and global seafood supply. Effective reduction of the impacts of flood vulnerability depends on level and readiness of the adaptive capacity. This study investigated key factors affecting the adaptive capacity of shrimp farmers in Thailand. This case study focused on the largest shrimp farming areas at a provincial level. Data collection was carried out using questionnaires and person-to-person interviews. Approximately 100 shrimp farmers who had experienced previous flood events were interviewed to help classify the impact scales of key factors on adaptation. Five socio-economic characteristics (education level, farming experience, income level, farm size, and supplemental occupations) are important factors in making the decision to apply adaptive alternatives. Currently, the main adaptive practices employed by shrimp farmers in the study area are placing nets around ponds and constructing dykes to enclose shrimp ponds. However, poverty and limited access to financial resources are the major constraints affecting the adaptive capacity to combat future flooding events. For farmers whose farms are located in vulnerable areas and who have limited financial resource, an implementation of non-structural techniques, such as changing crop patterns and altering harvest seasons, should be promoted.

AB  - Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis is a potentially powerful tool for identifying risk factors associated with contagious caprine pleuropneumonia (CCPP) and the important interactions between them. Our objective was therefore to determine the seroprevalence and identify the risk factors associated with CCPP using CART data mining modeling in the most densely sheep- and goat-populated governorates. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 620 animals (390 sheep, 230 goats) distributed over four governorates in the Nile Delta of Egypt in 2019. The randomly selected sheep and goats from different geographical study areas were serologically tested for CCPP, and the animals’ information was obtained from flock men and farm owners. Six variables (geographic location, species, flock size, age, gender, and communal feeding and watering) were used for risk analysis. Multiple stepwise logistic regression and CART modeling were used for data analysis. A total of 124 (20%) serum samples were serologically positive for CCPP. The highest prevalence of CCPP was between aged animals (>4 y; 48.7%) raised in a flock size ≥200 (100%) having communal feeding and watering (28.2%). Based on logistic regression modeling (area under the curve, AUC = 0.89; 95% CI 0.86 to 0.91), communal feeding and watering showed the highest prevalence odds ratios (POR) of CCPP (POR = 3.7, 95% CI 1.9 to 7.3), followed by age (POR = 2.1, 95% CI 1.6 to 2.8) and flock size (POR = 1.1, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.2). However, higher-accuracy CART modeling (AUC = 0.92, 95% CI 0.90 to 0.95) showed that a flock size >100 animals is the most important risk factor (importance score = 8.9), followed by age >4 y (5.3) followed by communal feeding and watering (3.1). Our results strongly suggest that the CCPP is most likely to be found in animals raised in a flock size >100 animals and with age >4 y having communal feeding and watering. Additionally, sheep seem to have an important role in the CCPP epidemiology. The CART data mining modeling showed better accuracy than the traditional logistic regression.

AB  - This study covers the methodological gap in determining adoption of adaptation strategies towards changing climate by farmers, in semi-arid region of Pakistan. By considering significance as well as scale of adoption, the study derived an adaptation index and studied determinants and barriers affecting successful adoption of different adaptation strategies, mainly by conducting Focal Group Discussion (FGD), experts’ interviews and household survey. Based on survey from 200 rice growers of Pakistan, the adaptations identified include elevated rates of irrigation, on-farm storage, alteration in fertilizer rates, weather forecasting and soil conservation techniques. Further, influence of different socioeconomic factors on adoption of adaptations is unraveled by using multiple linear regression approach. Results reveal the impact of farming experience, education of farmer, family size, access to credit, involvement in non-farm activities, belief on climate change and relevant adaptations is significant on adoption of adaptations. It suggests that implementation policies for adaptations should be revised, by considering vital role of these socioeconomic characteristics as well as local level actions of farmers.

AB  - Ethiopian agriculture is a vulnerable sector to climate variability, wherein this study identified how strong is the effect on smallholders' crop income in central highland farming system of the country. The study used fixed effect regression to analyze the unbalanced panel data (1994–2014) collected for eight rounds. The model result shows that individual increment in cropping season rainfall or temperature has negative and significant effect on households' crop income in the farming system. Parallel increment of the two climate variability related inputs had positive and significant effect on crop income. Other variables like flood, frost, storm, and rainfall inconsistency in the onset and cessation time affected households' crop income negatively and significantly. Similarly, draft power and human labor, which are critical inputs in the crop production of Ethiopian smallholders, have positive and significant effect on crop income as to the model result. Thus, this study recommended that there should be supplementation of rainwater through irrigation, water harvesting, and other activities to have consistent water supply for the crop production. Additionally, long-lasting measures like afforestation should be adopted to counterbalance the negative effect of temperature increment.

AB  - This paper examines how farmers adapt to climate change through innovation diffusion amidst declining indigenous agricultural knowledge and practices in Ghana. Small-scale farmers rely on indigenous practices and technological diffusion to cope with change even where the adoption levels of externally promoted technologies can be slow. The paper uses a qualitative case study to explore an in-depth understanding of climate change, innovation diffusion and indigenous knowledge. Data was collected through fifty interviews, eight focus groups and five hundred and forty-five surveys to develop insights into how farmers adapt to climatic changes, technologies, and knowledge systems. While traditional practices such as planting drought-resistant crops and manuring are relevant for adapting to climate change, some farmers integrate modern technologies and practices to improve productivity based on knowledge and resource availabilities. Farmers’ actions are sometimes structured in everyday social practices and new technologies. Technological diffusion among farmers is informed by lived experiences and external structures, explaining why changes occur differently across communities. While some traditional knowledge systems are less popular among young and educated farmers, older farmers grapple with continuity and change in technologies and practices. This research has implications for how the government engage farmers on existing knowledge, innovation, and climate change.

AB  - The scarcity of non-renewable fertilizers resources and the consequences of climate change can dramatically influence the food security of future generation. Introduction of high yielding varieties, intensive cropping sequence and increasing demand of food grains day-by-day, application of recommended dose of fertilizers could not fulfill our targets due to outdated fertilizers recommendations are yet in practice. It not only alters soil quality, nutrient balance, microbial and enzymatic ecology but also affected productivity and sustainability of rice in Gangetic alluvial soils of India. The effect of fertilizers application based on "fertilizing the soil versus fertilizing the crop" which insure real balance between the applied and available soil nutrient is urgently needed. Hence, the present study was conducted during three consecutive crop seasons (2010, 2011, and 2012) to assess the effect of imbalance and balance fertilization based on initial soil test values and targeted yields, and to determine the effect of farmyard manure (FYM) when superimposed with balanced fertilizers on identification of minimum data set for the development soil quality, nutrient acquisition, and grain yield of rice. The six fertilizer treatments were laid out in a randomized block design with three replications. The treatments were: T1-control (no fertilization), T2-farmyard manure @ 5 t ha−1, T3-farmers practice (60:30:30 kg N:P2O5:K2O ha−1), T4-precise application of mineral fertilizers based on initial soil test values (77:24:46 kg N:P2O5:K2O ha−1) for targeted grain yield of 4.0 t ha−1, T5-precise application of mineral fertilizers based on initial soil test values (74:23:43 kg N:P2O5:K2O ha−1) plus FYM (5 t ha−1) for targeted grain yield of 4.0 t ha−1 and T6-precise application of mineral fertilizers based on initial soil test values (135:34:65 kg N:P2O5:K2O ha−1) for targeted rice grain yield of 5.0 t ha−1. Result revealed that the targeted rice grain yield of 4.0 and 5.0 t ha−1 was achieved in T4 and T6 treatments with 1.59% (4.06 t ha−1) and –3.40% (4.83 t ha−1) deviations, respectively. T4, T5, and T6 significantly increased crop growth, nutrient uptake, available P (Pa) and K (Ka) and augmented rice grain yield by 10.6, 20.2 and 31.6%, respectively, over T3. Microbial biomass carbon, soil respiration and enzymatic activity were enhanced significantly in T5 as compared to T6. Highest soil quality index was found in T5 (0.95) followed by T6 (0.90) and, lowest was in T1 (0.63). The contribution of minimum data set (MDS) toward the SQI was in the descending order of ALP (30.6%) > SOC (21.5%) > Ka (11.3%) > PSM (9.68%) > Na (8.51%). Overall, rice yield and soil quality was improved by using balance fertilization based on fertilizing the crop Vs fertilizing the soil in alluvial soils of India.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to estimate the potential risks of climate change on economic crop production and to design weather index insurance schemes in four regions of Thailand. To obtain reliable estimates of the moment-based production function, the unit root tests and feasible generalized least squares involving a panel data model are explored using economic crop production and weather data from the provincial level from 1989 to 2017. The findings revealed that the primary weather variables (temperature and rainfall) have a significant impact on crop production. This study proposed weather index insurance as an institutional safeguard against the risk of reduced crop production due to climate change for 2030 2060 and 2090. According to the weather index insurance design, the insurance schemes have a risk reduction performance of 8.14 and 13.37 percent for rice, 2.43 and 6.48 percent for oil palm, and 8.89 and 14.13 percent for rubber tree, respectively. Weather index insurance is a guideline that farmers can use to mitigate the adverse effects of future climate change on economic crop production. The main contribution of this study is the proposal of an insurance scheme and the investigation of whether this measurement can effectively protect crop production losses due to climate change scenarios. However, weather index insurance continues to face persistent social inclusion and sustainable development challenges, which have an impact on the overall effectiveness of insurance schemes.

AB  - We investigated the impact of climate variables on yield and biomass gap variability in two humid topical regions, Brong-Ahafo and Ashanti region, of central Ghana using the crop model LINTUL5 embedded into a general modeling framework, SIMPLACE (Scientific Impact Assessment and Modelling Platform for Advanced Crop and Ecosystem Management). The simulations were run using a late maturity maize variety (Obatanpa) and historical weather data (1992–2007) across the 18 districts of the regions studied. The simulated maize yield and biomass production under water-limited conditions varied spatially which was significantly correlated with the solar radiation and precipitation in the crop growing period (R2 =0.99; p <0.05), whereas, associated temporal variability in the simulated maize yield was significantly correlated with the radiation in the crop growing period (R2 =0.96; p <0.05). The temporal variability in the simulated potential biomass production was significantly correlated with the solar radiation and average temperature in the crop growing period (R2 =0.93; p <0.05), postulating that the solar radiation and the mean temperature are the limiting climatic factor in the study regions. Yield gaps and biomass gaps ranged between 8.8Mgha−1 to 10.0Mgha−1 and 14.8Mgha−1 to 17.1Mgha−1 respectively across the districts. Thus average farmer’s yield and biomass is only 17% and 13% of the simulated water-limited yield and biomass respectively. The spatial and temporal variability in yield gap was positively correlated with the radiation during the crop growing period. Associated spatial variability in biomass gap was positively correlated with radiation and negatively with the precipitation, whereas temporal variability in the biomass gap was positively correlated with the radiation during the crop growing period. Thus, under the current input intensities in humid, tropical Central Ghana, neither maize grain and biomass yields nor the potential water limited yields are significantly positively related to precipitation during the growing cycle. Closing the large yield gaps will require in the first place adequate supply of nutrients.

We present ClimeGreAq, a software-based Decision Support System (DSS) co-created with stakeholders to support the adaptation of Greek aquaculture to climate change. The DSS is based on an integrated modeling approach which links a biological and an economic model in order to simulate the effects of climate drivers on Greek aquaculture in a spatially heterogeneous manner. The tool may be used by stakeholders including farmers, producer organizations, regional administrations and national authorities to support decision-making on questions ranging from selecting appropriate farming locations, to designating zones for aquaculture activities, to developing national climate adaptation plans. Along with a description of the DSS design process, its structure, and the constituent models, key results are presented relating to stakeholder involvement, the user interface, and several application examples.

AB  - Purpose This study responded to the disproportionate impacts of climate extremes on smallholder farmers in the Global South by developing frugal innovation tools and strategies to support climate resilience and agricultural decision-making through community-academic partnerships. Design/methodology/approach Using a community-based participatory approach, academic researchers collaborated with a local development organization and stakeholders through remote focus groups and surveys to co-develop the NicaAgua mobile app. Designed for areas with limited internet connectivity and digital literacy, the app integrates real-time weather data, short- and long-term forecasts and historical climate trends, with user-friendly visuals and interpretive guidance. Findings Frugal innovation and community engagement identified six key functionalities prioritized by users: short and seasonal forecasts, early warnings, local weather station data, climate change metrics and the moon phase. The app showed moderate to high forecasting skill at local scales. Community feedback confirmed the need for accessible forecast tools tailored to local indicators, while also revealing barriers such as low digital literacy and internet access. Despite widespread smartphone ownership, older adults and women often faced challenges in app use, requiring inclusive design strategies. Originality/value This study presents a frugal, community-driven approach to localizing global climate science for vulnerable farming communities. It highlights effective strategies for designing equitable, accessible digital tools to support climate adaptation, offers lessons on fostering transboundary academic-community collaboration and contributes to building smallholder farmers’ capacity to manage climate risks in Central America.

AB  - Sugarcane is a major crop to produce sugar accounting for nearly 80% of sugar production worldwide. Sugarcane is well adapted to warm climates and accumulated high biomass quantities for bioelectricity and second-generation bioethanol. Although Indonesia is one among the cane sugar producers, the produced sugar has been unable to meet the national sugar demand. The study of physiology, molecular biology and genetic is providing a major impetus to develop biotechnological strategies for increasing growth and productivity in sugarcane. Genetic transformation method for sugarcane has been established, including Agrobacterium -mediated transformation method. The Agrobacterium -mediated transformation has been successfully employed to develop transgenic sugarcane. The overexpression of SoSPS gene encoding for sucrosephosphate synthase (SPS) showed the increases of activity and sucrose content in transgenic sugarcane. Furthermore, field evaluation on growth and productivity of the transgenic sugarcane displayed higher tiller number, plant high, cane yield, percentage of Brix and Pol compared to nontransgenic sugarcane. Furthermore, plants are subjected to a variety of abiotic and biotic stresses, which reduces and limits crop productivity. Plants adapt to water stress with various strategies include change in the gene expression and accumulation of organic compounds called compatible solutes. Genetic transformation of betA gene encoding for choline dehydrogenase in bacteria elevated glycine-betaine content as an osmoprotectant and resulted in water stress tolerant of transgenic sugarcane. The drought tolerant of sugarcane was already approved and released by Indonesian Government for commercialization. In addition, mosaic virus is one of the most severe diseases in sugarcane and lead to the constant losses in growth and yield of sugarcane. Pathogen-derived resistance (PDR) and RNA interference (RNAi) technologies have been applied to engineered sugarcane cultivar resistant to mosaic virus, and that the RNAi method produced more resistant against the mosaic virus in sugarcane. Finaly, biotechnology approach of genome editing technology should be exploited to ensure higher sugarcane productivity, and improve the livelihoods of smallholder farmers.

AB  - Abstract Research on human activities and socioeconomic development analysis on the Marine Ecological Carrying Capacity (MECC) evaluation index to climate change adaptation at the Sentra Kelautan dan Perikanan Terpadu (SKPT) Nunukan Regency, North Kalimantan in 2015-2019 has been carried out. The purpose of this study was to determine changes in human activity and socioeconomic development of MECC as an evaluation of adaptation and mitigation to climate change. The method using in this research is an approach to the concept of Integrated Ocean Management (IOM) in the form of MECC. MECC can be used as a tool to see the effectiveness and efficiency of a policy on the environment. MECC consists of two components, namely carrying object (OI) and carrier resilience (RI). Carrying object analysis was performed to determine changes in the value of the human activity index and socio-economic development. The value of the carrying index which consists of human activities (HI) and socio-economic development (SI) activities in Nunukan Regency shows a decline during 2015-2019. The value of HI decreased by 82% from 0.19 in 2015 to 0.03 in 2019 due to increased activity in the fisheries and marine transportation sectors. Meanwhile, the SI value in 2014 was 0.25, down 57% to 0.11 in 2019. This was due to the increase in socio-economic activities in Nunukan Regency. Adaptive capacity can be the main key in preventing a decrease in the carrying index. The form of adaptive capacity carried out by utilizing information, building partnerships among the private and non-private sectors, strengthening stakeholder involvement and control, growing capacity constructing, enforcing regulatory frameworks, and protecting weather change and different environmental adjustments in adaptive management structures.

AB  - There is a paucity of information on conditioning factors that hinder or promote adoption of multiple climate-smart practices and on the synergies among such practices in increasing household resilience by improving agricultural income. This study analyzes how heat, rainfall, and rainfall variability affect farmers’ choices of a portfolio of potential climate smart practices — agricultural water management, improved crop seeds, and fertilizer — and the impact of these practices on farm income in the Nile Basin of Ethiopia. We apply a multinomial endogenous switching regression approach by modeling combinations of practices and net farm income for each combination as depending on household and farm characteristics and on a set of climatic variables based on geo-referenced historical precipitation and temperature data. A primary result of this study is that farmers are less likely to adopt fertilizer (either alone or in combination with improved varieties) in areas of greater rainfall variability. However, even when there is high variability in rainfall, farmers are more likely to adopt these two yield-increasing inputs when they choose to (and are able to) include the third part of the portfolio: agricultural water management. Net farm income responds positively to agricultural water management, improved crop variety or fertilizer when they are adopted in isolation as well as in combination. But this effect is greater when these practices are combined. Simulation results suggest that a warming temperature and decreased precipitation in future decades will make it less likely that farmers will adopt practices in isolation but more likely that they will adopt a combination of practices. Hence, a package approach rather than a piecemeal approach is needed to maximize the synergies implicit in various climate smart practices.

AB  - The study focuses on climate change impacts on the environmental flow indicators from hydrologic method point of view using IWMI’s Global Environmental Flow Calculator and Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration. It also discusses how the changes in flow magnitude and duration of annual extreme conditions, timing of annual extreme water condition, frequency and duration of high and low pulses, rate and frequency of water condition changes will affect the ecosystem. Climate change disturbs the ecology by directly affecting the functions of individual organisms (growth and behavior), modifying the population (size and age structure), and altering the ecosystem structure, functioning (e.g., decomposition, nutrient cycling, water flows, and species composition and species interactions) and its distribution within landscapes (Gitay et al., 2002). Ecosystem regime shifts can occur naturally and by anthropogenic factors (Muenich et al. in Ecol Model 340:116–125, 2016). Climate change effects on flow regime are expressed by different indicators such as mean annual runoff, mean river discharge, low and high flows, mean seasonal discharge, and changes from permanent to intermittent flow or vice versa. Understanding of changes in flow regimes is important for the well-being of humans and freshwater-dependent biota with respect to water and habitat availability (Döll and Schmied in Environ Res Lett 7(1):14037, 2012). Even though the basin is rich in fish species, peoples living in lower Omo-Gibe basin and Turkana region are undertaking a traditional fishing culture. Wildlife in the parks, pastoralist communities using the flood recession farming and livestock farming are dependent on the river. The environmental flow that sustains these activities is inevitably necessary for the survival of the biodiversity. Understanding of the flow variability helps to protect the freshwater biodiversity and maintenance of goods and services that the river provides.

AB  - the average mangrove forest and shrimp pond ratio was 56.90:42.70 (%). Two technical issues were highlighted: (i) the use of rotenone, known as a toxin to kill undesirable fish before stocking shrimp, and (ii) annual shrimp pond regeneration causing increased pollution. The data showed that higher concentrations of TSS and P-PO 43-were detected in surrounding rivers, while surface water in either IMSF ponds or adjacent rivers slightly surpassed the permissible levels of total Fe concentration. All parameters—including heavy metals; toxic and persistent parameters; oil and grease and coliforms analysed in surface water, and sediment samples—were lower than the detection and permissible levels. The results provided evidence that the IMSF’s practices and environmental characteristics were suitable for recommending the Naturland Standards. Recommendations and technical interventions for farmers are necessary to help reduce Fe levels and the safe use of rotenone in IMSF systems. An environmental quality monitoring programme at the target area should be applied when launching organic shrimp production.

AB  - We analyze the contributions of integrated watershed management (IWM) to disaster risk reduction and community development across three case study sites in Nepal. A mixed-method case study approach adopted in the study used policy review, focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and semi-structured interviews to collect data in Kulekhani watershed, Bangari-Dudhoura watershed, and Harion watersheds. Our study shows a significant reduction in the number of disasters along with notable improvements in land cover and multiple benefits to the community. Across the study sites, we noted a significant increase in forest cover with sightings of wildlife and an increase in water levels in areas that were previously highly degraded. Among the benefits to the people are the restoration and regeneration of forests that have been conserved and handed over to the communities. Our findings indicate that, through community forestry under IWM, the local people have not only benefitted from the sale and use of forest products like timber, fuelwood, and fodder but their capacities, especially that of women, in terms of communicating and networking, have improved. However, many challenges remain. Limited coordination among different sectors, over-lapping of responsibilities among institutions and authorities, limited upstream-downstream linkages, and less priority for disasters risk reduction in IWM are among them. Therefore, we conclude that prioritizing disaster risk reduction actions in IWM across Nepal and advocating for horizontal as well as vertical collaboration and cooperation to strengthen upstream-downstream linkages and to augment the socio-ecological resilience of the watersheds are necessary.

AB  - Climatic change has a negative impact on people’s livelihoods, agriculture, freshwater supply and other natural resources that are important for human survival. Therefore, understanding how rural smallholder farmers perceive climate change, climate variability, and factors that influence their choices would facilitate a better understanding of how these farmers adapt to the negative impacts of climate change. A Zero-inflated double hurdle model was employed to estimate the factors influencing farmers’ adoption of adaptation strategies and intensity of adoption at the household level in South Africa. Different socioeconomic factors such as gender, age, and experience in crop farming, institutional factors like access to extension services, and access to climate change information significantly influenced the adoption of climate change adaptation strategies among beneficiaries of land reform in South Africa. Concerning intensity of adoption, age, educational level, farming experience, on-farm training, off-farm income, access to information through ICT and locational variables are the significant determinants of intensity of adaptation strategies. Thus, education attainment, non-farm employment, farming experience are significant incentives to enhance smallholder farmers' adaptive capacity through the adoption of many adaptation approaches. This study therefore concluded that farm-level policy efforts that aim to improve rural development should focus on farmers’ education, on-farm demonstration and non-farm employment opportunities that seek to engage the farmers, particularly during the off-cropping season. The income from non-farm employment can be plough-back into farm operations such as the adoption of soil and water conservation, use of improved planting varieties, insurance, among others to mitigate climate variability and subsequently increase productivity. Policies and investment strategies of the government should be geared towards supporting education, providing on-farm demonstration trainings, and disseminating information about climate change adaptation strategies, particularly for smallholder farmers in the country. Thus, the government, stakeholders, and donor agencies must provide capacity-building innovations around the agricultural extension system and education on climate change using information and communication technologies.

AB  - The National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) sensor MODIS-Aqua provides an important tool for reliable observations of the changing ocean surface algal bloom paradigms in coastal and oceanic waters around India. A time series of the MODIS-Aqua-derived OSABI (ocean surface algal bloom index) and its seasonal composite images report new information and comprehensive pictures of these blooms and their evolution stages in a wide variety of events occurred at different times of the years from 2003 to 2011, providing the first large area survey of such phenomena around India. For most of the years, the results show a strong seasonal pattern of surface algal blooms elucidated by certain physical and meteorological conditions. The extent of these blooms reaches a maximum in winter (November–February) and a minimum in summer (June–September), especially in the northern Arabian Sea. Their spatial distribution and retention period are also significantly increased in the recent years. The increased spatial distribution and intensity of these blooms in the northern Arabian Sea in winter are likely caused by enhanced cooling, increased convective mixing, favorable winds, and atmospheric deposition of the mineral aerosols (from surrounding deserts) of the post-southwest monsoon period. The southward Oman coastal current and southwestward winds become apparently responsible for their extension up to the central Arabian Sea. Strong upwelling along this coast further triggers their initiation and growth. Though there is a warming condition associated with increased sea surface height anomalies along the coasts of India and Sri Lanka in winter, surface algal bloom patches are still persistent along these coasts due to northeast monsoonal winds, enhanced precipitation, and subsequent nutrient enrichment in these areas. The occurrence of the surface algal blooms in the northern Bay of Bengal coincides with a region of the well-known Ganges–Brahmaputra Estuarine Frontal (GBEF) system, which increases supply of nutrients in addition to the land-derived inputs triggering surface algal blooms in this region. Low density (initiation stage) of such blooms observed in clear oceanic waters southeast and northeast of Sri Lanka may be caused by the vertical mixing processes (strong monsoonal winds) and the occurrence of Indian Ocean Dipole events. Findings based on the analyses of time series satellite data indicate that the new information on surface algal blooms will have important bearing on regional fisheries, ecosystem and environmental studies, and implications of climate change scenarios.

AB  - Chickpea is mainly grown in the west and north west of Iran in dryland conditions, and in most areas, it is planted as post rainy season crop from March to late May. Due to irregular, untimely and insufficient rainfall in cultivated areas, this plant is usually suffering from drought during flowering and pod filling stages, which are the most susceptible stages of chickpea growth. Utilization of local genetic diversity that are useful sources of adaptation gene to environmental changes is a starting point and a functional approach to overcome this problem. Assuming the local chickpea accession conserved in National Plant Gene Bank of Iran (NPGBI) have appropriate diversity for terminal drought tolerance, a research was conducted with the aim of identify drought tolerant accessions and determining their yield potential under dryland condition. Materials and methods Seventy Kabuli chickpea landraces were identified as tolerant accessions in different previous projects were done in NPGBI entered to this study. The experiment was held in Sanandaj and Karaj research station both in two different treatments. Control and drought treatments, through cutting off irrigation at flowering stage till maturity, in Karaj and dryland and complementary irrigation treatments, using two additional irrigations during flowering and pod filling, in Sanandaj station. The accessions were planted in the second half of March in augmented design, during 2016-17 growing season. Different agronomical traits were recorded, quantitative drought tolerance and susceptibility indices, were calculated and based of them accessions were grouped using the principle component and cluster analysis.Results and discussion  Based on the results, a significant decrease in day to maturity, flowering period, canopy height and width, plant weight, pods number and weight per plant, seeds number per plant, plant yield, biomass, yield and harvest index were observed in drought stress conditions. There was considerable variation in yield and yield components, biomass and harvest index, among understudied landraces. Seed production increased by 9.7 and 1.3 times under irrigation treatment in Karaj and Sanandaj, respectively.Principal component analysis across tolerant and susceptible indices and considering eigen values greater than or equal to 1.0 showed that in both locations, two components together accounted for 92.32 and 99.33 percent of variation. The first component contributed most of the variability 52.18% in Karaj and 83.62% in Sanandaj was explained by variation in HM, STI, GMP and MP indices. The second component was explained by the diversity among genotypes for TOL and SSI indices. Hence, accession number KC.215172, KC.215286, KC215369 and KC.216010 in Sanandaj station and accession number KC.215286, KC.215727, KC215442, KC.215443, and KC.216023 in Karaj with higher amount of GMP and STI indices and lower amount of TOL and SSI were among more drought tolerance accessions.Cluster analysis based on evaluated traits and calculated drought tolerance and susceptibility indices, were divided accessions in to 3 clusters in Karaj. The cluster number three that TOl and SSI indices and the percentage of unfilled pods had lower values than the total average and plant weight, seed and pod number per plant, seed and pod weight per plant, biomass, yield, harvest index and STI and GMP indices have higher values than the average was called drought tolerant cluster. Accessions number KC.215727, KC.215442, KC.215710, KC.216023 were this cluster member.  The cluster number 4 that had high yield potential and high STI and GMP indices

AB  - In terms of meteorological prediction, it is broadly recognized that meteorological forecasts based on both local knowledge and science have strengths and weaknesses. It is also argued that actions taken by farmers in response to the meteorological information they receive are influenced by a range of factors or constraints. These constraints often require appropriate top-down support. This study examines the integration of sources of meteorological knowledge (i.e. local and scientific) and actions (i.e. both top-down support and bottom-up initiatives) within coconut farming communities in the Philippines. A case study approach using a variety of qualitative and quantitative methods is adopted for data collection. Although the study shows that the integration of local knowledge and scientific meteorological information merely occurs spontaneously at individual level, and that the integration of top-down and bottom-up actions remains ineffective, it also points to the need for knowledge and actions to be integrated at community level.

AB  - Climate variability, climate change, and extreme events can compound the vulnerability of people heavily reliant on agriculture. Those with intersecting disadvantages, such as women, the poor, and ethnic minority groups, may be particularly affected. Understanding and assessing diverse vulnerabilities, especially those related to ethnicity, are therefore potentially important to the development of policies and programs aimed at enabling adaptation in such groups. This study uses a livelihood vulnerability index (LVI) method, along with qualitative data analysis, to compare the vulnerability of different smallholder farmers in Son La province, one of the poorest provinces in Vietnam. Data were collected from 240 households, representing four minority ethnic groups. The results indicated that household vulnerability is influenced by factors such as income diversity, debt, organizational membership, support from and awareness by local authorities, access to health services, water resources, and location. Results revealed that two of the ethnic groups’ households were, on average, more vulnerable, particularly regarding livelihood strategies, health, water, housing and productive land, and social network items when compared to the other two ethnic groups. The study shows the need for targeted interventions to reduce the vulnerability of these and similarly placed small ethnic communities.

AB  - This paper presents the first attempt to capture a comprehensive spatial view of land use change in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD) for a long period, i.e., from 2000 to 2020. It is aimed at monitoring holistically the land use change and flooding situation in the region, addressing the reasons for land use change, and assessing the impacts of land use change on hydraulic aspects and farmer livelihoods during the last 21 years. MODIS products, in particular, are used to study the dynamics of land use and floods after demonstrating high validation with statistical data and radar satellites, with R2 = 0.96 and R2 ≥ 0.97 for land use and flood maps, respectively. The results show that rice cultivation is the most dominant land use type, accounting for 40% to 46% of the delta area, while aquaculture accounts for 10% to 22%, respectively. The total rice cultivation area increased from 3764 thousand hectares (thous. ha) in 2001 to 4343 thous. ha in 2015 based on the intensive development of triple rice cropping in the upper zone, then decreased to 3963 thous. ha in 2020. In contrast, aquaculture areas are farmed mainly in the coastal area and remained relatively steady, increasing slightly from 619 thous. ha in 2001 to 856 thous. ha in 2020. The massive construction of dikes for triple rice cropping in the upper zone appears to cause a significant impact on the annual flooding regime. Land use policies have influenced the changes in land use patterns, flooding situations, and the livelihoods of local farmers.

AB  - Smallholder farmers play a key role in global food production, but multiple stressors such as climate change are impacting their farming operations, posing serious challenges to their livelihoods as well as to global food security. The Chinese government is comprehensively promoting the modern transformation of smallholder farmers. Faced with the threat of multiple stressors, what farming decisions will smallholder farmers make? Can the modern transformation of smallholder farmers be sustained? There are no answers to these questions. In light of this, this paper investigates and analyzes the environmental and socio-economic stressors affecting smallholder farmers in China's coastal zones. The study applies an agent-based model to explore the long-term dynamic farming decisions and agricultural transformation of smallholder farmers experiencing multiple stressors. The different effects of relieving environmental and socio-economic stressors are compared. The results show that coastal smallholder farmers environment-based stress, related to perennial drought, diseases and pests, is more prominent than socio-economic stress. Furthermore, under multiple stressors, trends such as abandoning farmland and shifting to non-agricultural land are significantly in coastal zones. It is difficult to promote the agricultural modernization of smallholder farmers in the long term. To minimize land abandonment and promote transformation, reducing environmental stresses is more effective than reducing social-economic stresses. Therefore, the government should prioritize addressing prominent environmental issues to meet the basic conditions for coastal smallholder farming, and specifically resolve key socio-economic problems. This approach will further enhance the willingness of coastal smallholders to farm, alleviate their pressures, and promote the modernization transformation of agriculture.

AB  - Crop diversification is a farming practice for risk management prevalent in smallholder agriculture, offering adaptive benefits against challenges like climate change, price fluctuations, and crop disease. Despite its importance, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding of the relationship of crop diversification and current and historical climate shock. Our study seeks to bridge this gap through statistical analysis of household- and district-level data in Zambia. Specifically, we use the Pooled Fractional Probit (PFP) estimator to develop regression models for crop diversification, analyzing 6625 households for 3 years and 74 districts for 9 years, using Rural Agriculture Living Survey (RALS) and Crop Forecast Survey (CFS) datasets, respectively. Simpson’s Diversity Index (SDI) of crops serves as the dependent variable and is consistently higher at the district level than at the household level, suggesting that aggregation at larger scales may mask localized monoculture vulnerabilities. Our findings reveal that both current and historical climate shocks significantly influence crop diversification decisions at both the household and district levels in Zambia. Heat stress and rainfall deficits during the planting season promote crop diversification, but their effects vary due to the diverse agroecological conditions and crop characteristics in different areas. Historical climate shocks prompt farmers to diversify as a long-term resilience strategy. This study emphasizes the complex, scale-dependent drivers of crop diversification in response to climate shocks, providing valuable insights for policy development in climate-resilient agricultural strategies.

AB  - This paper reviews the present condition of cocoa growing in West Africa where some six million ha are planted with cocoa which provide about 70 percent of the total world production. Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana are the largest producers, followed by Nigeria and Cameroon. In the beginning of the 21st century the cocoa production increased from about 2,000,000 tons to about 3,000,000 tons in 2010 and subsequent years. While in this period expansion of the cocoa area (at the expense of forest land) contributed to increased production, nowadays more cocoa has to come from higher yield per ha which is very low at present. This paper highlights at first cocoa growing in each of the cocoa producing countries and then deals with the common constraints and options to higher yields, especially those in Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana. The major causes of low yield are a high incidence of pests and diseases, the old age of cocoa farms and lack of soil nutrients. Concerns about declining output due to aging and diseased trees have urged the government of Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana to launch large rehabilitation and replanting schemes which provide farmers with improved planting materials, plant protection chemicals and fertilizers. As owners of small farms do not earn enough income from their cocoa to purchase external inputs, the traditional mixed planting of cocoa and forest and fruit trees and some oil palms is discussed as an alternative to a high input approach. This low input low output system is sustainable but not the way forward to higher yields. It is thought that in the short run higher cocoa prices and improved management including pest and disease control and to a certain extent fertilizer use offer scope for a larger cocoa output. In the more distant future the predicted climatic change and increased land use for food production will reduce the size of the cocoa area and affect the leading position of West Africa on the world cocoa market. This review shows that at present the conditions for sustainable production are not met and concludes that important structural changes in the cocoa sector are needed to reach this goal. These changes concern the economic viability of cocoa on small farms, extensive land use and the ecological impact of the current cocoa growing practice. The implementation of these changes requires area specific programs with as their common goal increased economic and environmentally sustainable cocoa production on less land.

AB  - Abstract Currently, sustainable food production is the biggest challenge in the world. The rapid growth of population, agricultural land conversion and climate change are the key challenges in the agricultural sector. Therefore, natural resources need to be utilised optimally to increase value-added and product competitiveness. This paper reviews the development of rice bioindustry in Indonesia with regards to food processing technology and challenges. Regarding the development of rice bio-industry, farmers and rice milling entrepreneurs are not only directed to focus on milled rice but also directed to valorise the by-products from rice milling manufacture namely rice bran, broken rice, brewers’ rice and husks into high value- added products. To improve the economic value of premium quality rice, functional rice (parboiled, low glycaemic index rice), fortified rice, instant rice, and crystal rice should be produced. Husk can be processed into non- food products, such as biosilica. Additionally, straw can be used as raw material for paper, furfural, sugar and bioethanol, as well as biodegradable packaging and nanofiber. The development of the rice bio industry by utilising all parts of the plant supports the zero waste concept that can increase the income of rice farmers and entrepreneurs, will also improving the environment.

AB  - Cyanobacterial blooms and aquatic vegetation dynamics are critical indicators of freshwater ecosystem health, increasingly shaped by climate change, nutrient enrichment, and ecological restoration efforts. Here, we present an automated monitoring system optimized for small- and medium-sized lakes. This system integrates phenology-based algorithms with Sentinel-2 MSI imagery, leveraging the AI Earth (AIE) platform developed by Alibaba DAMO Academy. Applied to monitor 12 ecologically sensitive lakes and reservoirs in Jiangsu Province, China, the system enables multi-year tracking of spatiotemporal changes from 2019 to 2024. A clear north-south gradient in cyanobacterial bloom intensity was observed, with southern lakes exhibiting higher bloom levels. Although bloom intensity decreased in lakes such as Changdang, Yangcheng, and Dianshan, Ge Lake displayed fluctuating patterns. In contrast, ecological restoration efforts in Cheng and Yuandang Lakes led to substantial increases in bloom intensity in 2024, with affected areas reaching 33.16% and 33.11%, respectively. Although bloom intensity remained low in northern lakes, increases were recorded in Hongze, Gaoyou, and Luoma Lakes after 2023, particularly in Hongze Lake, where bloom coverage surged to 3.29% in 2024. Aquatic vegetation dynamics displayed contrasting trends. In southern lakes—particularly Cheng, Dianshan, Yuandang, and Changdang Lakes—vegetation coverage significantly increased, with Changdang Lake reaching 44.56% in 2024. In contrast, northern lakes, including Gaoyou, Luoma, and Hongze, experienced a long-term decline in vegetation coverage. By 2024, compared to 2019, coverage in Gaoyou, Luoma, and Hongze Lakes decreased by 11.28%, 16.02%, and 47.32%, respectively. These declines are likely linked to increased grazing pressure following fishing bans, which may have disrupted vegetation dynamics and reduced their ability to suppress cyanobacterial blooms. These findings provide quantitative evidence supporting adaptive lake restoration strategies and underscore the effectiveness of satellite-based phenological monitoring in assessing freshwater ecosystem health.

AB  - Predicting spatial explicit information of soil nutrients is critical for sustainable soil management and food security under climate change and human disturbance in agricultural land. Digital soil mapping (DSM) techniques can utilize soil-landscape information from remote sensing data to predict the spatial pattern of soil nutrients, and it is important to explore the effects of remote sensing data types on DSM. This research utilized Landsat 8 (LT), Sentinel 2 (ST), and WorldView-2 (WV) remote sensing data and employed partial least squares regression (PLSR), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms to characterize the spatial pattern of soil total nitrogen (TN) in smallholder farm settings in Yellow River Basin, China. The overall relationships between TN and spectral indices from LT and ST were stronger than those from WV. Multiple red edge band-based spectral indices from ST and WV were relevant variables for TN, while there were no red band-based spectral indices from ST and WV identified as relevant variables for TN. Soil moisture and vegetation were major driving forces of soil TN spatial distribution in this area. The research also concluded that farmlands of crop rotation had relatively higher TN concentration compared with farmlands of monoculture. The soil prediction models based on WV achieved relatively lower model performance compared with those based on ST and LT. The effects of remote sensing data spectral resolution and spectral range on enhancing soil prediction model performance are higher than the effects of remote sensing data spatial resolution. Soil prediction models based on ST can provide location-specific soil maps, achieve fair model performance, and have low cost. This research suggests DSM research utilizing ST has relatively high prediction accuracy, and can produce soil maps that are fit for the spatial explicit soil management for smallholder farms.

AB  - Aims:The Nujiang River is an important international river in Southwest China.It is known as one of the world's biodiversity hotspots, and the region is rich in unique fish resources.Due to its geographical location and topographical conditions, there is a lack of systematic studies on the species diversity and distribution patterns of fish species in the Nujiang River Basin.Methods: In this study, fish composition information of the Nujiang River Basin was systematically sorted out based on data from a five-year field sample of the river basin, as well as data from literature, books and online databases.The spatial distribution patterns of the Nujiang River Basin fish species were analyzed via clustering and ordination methods. Results:The results revealed that there were 85 indigenous fish species in the Nujiang River Basin.These fishes belong to 5 orders, 12 families and 47 genera.There were also 18 exotic fish species that belong to 3 orders, 8 families and 16genera, in addition, two exotic species were newly recorded by field investigation.The fish diversity in the Nujiang River Basin significantly increased from the upper reach to lower reach.According to the results of clustering and ordination analysis of fish composition, the 25 sub-basins of the Nujiang River can be divided into three parts: (1) The upper reach in the Tibet Autonomous Region, there were 15 species.Fish of Schizothoracine and Triplophysa were dominant species, indicating a typical fauna characteristic of cold-water fish in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.(2) In the middle reach from Gongshan to Lushui, there were 36 species.Aside from the cold-water fish species of the upper reach, fish of Barbinae and Labeoninae were also presented in this area.Fauna characteristics demonstrated the change from plateau fish species to plain fish species.(3) In the lower reach below Lushui, there were 74 species.Among them, the thermophilic fishes of Barbinae, Labeoninae, and Danioninae were widely distributed in the main stream, while a large number of Schistura and Glyptothorax fishes were more likely to be found in tributaries.The fish composition of this section has characteristics of tropical river and floodplain fauna.In recent years (2017-2021), several surveys have found only 43 native fish species together (50.6% of the historical records), and fishery resources in the Nujiang River Basin were decreasing significantly.Conclusion: Overfishing, development of small hydropower stations in tributaries, and the invasion of exotic fish species were the main threats to the native fish of the Nujiang River Basin.With the rapid increase in human activities, fish in the Nujiang River Basin were greatly threatened.Thus, systematic management and conservation planning for fish resources at the watershed-level are urgently needed.

AB  - Gajahmungkur reservoir is administratively located in Wonogiri Regency, Central Java, with the main function as a flood control in the upstream of Bengawan Solo River. Other functions of the reservoir are as hydroelectric power plant (PLTA), water supply, irrigation, fisheries and tourism. Economic utilization of the reservoir is estimated until 100 years, but it is begun to be threatened by the silting of the reservoir. Eroded materials entering water body will be suspended and accumulated. Suspended Material or TSS (Total Suspended Solid) will increase the turbidity of water, which can affect the quality of water and silting the reservoir. Remote sensing technology can be used to determine the spatial distribution of TSS. The purposes of this study were to 1) utilize and compare the accuracy of single band Landsat 8 OLI for mapping the spatial distribution of TSS and 2) estimate the TSS on Gajahmungkur reservoir surface waters up to the depth of 30 cm. The method used for modelling the TSS spatial distribution is the empirical modelling that integrates image pixel values and field data using correlation analysis and regression analysis. The data used in the empirical modelling are single band of visible, NIR, and SWIR of Landsat 8 OLI, which was acquired on 8 May 2016, and field-measured TSS values based on the field data collection conducted on 12 April 2016. The results revealed that mapping the distribution and the estimated value of TSS in Reservoir Gajahmungkur can be performed more accurately using band 4 (red band). The determinant coefficient between TSS field and TSS value of image using band 4 is 0.5431. The Standard Error (SE) of the predicted TSS value is 16.16 mg/L. The results also showed that the estimated total TSS of May 2016 according to band 4 is 1.087,56 tons. The average estimation of TSS value in up to the depth of 30 cm is 61.61 mg/L. The highest TSS distribution is in the northern parts, which was dominated by eroded materials from Keduang River.

AB  - Sugar beet sowing in 2020 began on March 14, when the first plots were sown. This term is among the earlier sowing start dates. Soil preparation was technologically complex, in particular to prevent water evaporation from the soil. The sowing began subsequently also on larger areas. The weather was not typical spring. Frosty days alternated with days with high temperatures, with strong ones with constant wind and with precipitation that would be possible called as a few drops without effect. Missing precipitation in progress sows and after it resulted in an uneven emergence of sugar beet with the number of individuals at the level of 76 thousand. plants per hectare. The condition of the stands in June and July was finally good only after heavy rainfall and there was hope for at least an average harvest. Fungicide treatments were performed as needed and the leaf apparatus sugar beet was at a satisfactory level until the beginning of September, when higher cercospore pressure was noted. Based on information from Austria, we applied pheromones beetroot beetle (Bothynoderes punctiventris), which is a big topic for Austrian colleagues. This the pest attacks and eats large areas of sugar beet.

AB  - Encouraging the use of conservation tillage technology is a highly effective approach to safeguarding soil health, improving the environment, and promoting sustainable agricultural development. With the mounting concerns surrounding climate change, developing conservation tillage methods that facilitate sustainable agricultural growth has become an imperative both in China and around the world. While it is widely recognized that adapting to climate change is crucial in agriculture, there is limited research on evaluating the risks, discovering resilience, measuring farmers’ perceptions on climate change, and exploring how tillage technology can be adjusted in the context of small-scale farming in China to foster sustainable development. Using research data from smallholder farmers in the Shaanxi and Shanxi provinces of China, this paper aims to explore the impact of climate change perceptions on farmers’ adoption of conservation tillage technologies based on an ordered Probit model. We found that farmers tend to refrain from embracing conservation tillage technology due to the presence of unclear and conflicting perceptions regarding climate change. Focus on short-term profitability and inadequate preparation hinder them from prioritizing adaptation. We recognized several measures that could help farmers adapt and thrive within the agricultural sector. Furthermore, we have validated the need for self-system moderation in promoting farmers’ adoption of conservation tillage technology. By utilizing such tools and resources, farmers can comprehend the gravity of climate change’s impact on agricultural productivity and, more importantly, channel their efforts towards fortifying resilience to extreme weather conditions and long-term climate risks, thus fortifying agricultural sustainability.

AB  - Abstract Crop loss and ensuing social crises can be detrimental for the agriculture-driven economy of India. Though some studies identify country-wide increasing temperatures as the dominant factor for crop loss, the agro-climatic diversity within the country necessitates an understanding of the influence of climate variability on yields at regional scales. We report a complex interplay among rainfall, temperature and cropping choices, with a focus on the drought-prone Marathwada region in Maharashtra. Our analysis based on observations, as well as statistical and process-based modelling experiments, and temperature projections of 1.5 °C and 2 °C warmer worlds show that for the two major cropping seasons, rainfall deficit is the primary cause of crop failure, as compared to rising temperatures. The gradual shift from drought-resilient food crops, such as sorghum and pearl-millet to water-intensive cash crops such as sugarcane in recent years, is seemingly responsible for aggravating this crisis. Our findings warrant strategies promoting drought-resilient food crops, that will be useful, not only for mitigating the immediate agrarian crisis, but also for curbing impending threats to food security in the region under future climate change.

AB  - Irrigation system is a scare resource in most of drought-stricken Africa. How to manage and maintain the existing irrigation facilities in Africa is a debatable issue to both policy makers and beneficiaries. Irrigation facilities run by farmer cooperatives are considered ineffective, unsuccessful and dysfunctional in Tanzania by many researchers. A cooperative irrigation scheme is a mechanism that features the collective management of rural irrigation facilities by farmers’ cooperative with some government intervention and external support. There is an increasing emphasis on the roles of cooperative irrigation scheme in the development of the agriculture sector and poverty reduction of smallholder farmers. In this study, the authors investigated the management and services of this scheme and analyzed its contribution to poverty reduction of smallholder rice farmers and community development in Tanzania through both quantitative and qualitative methods. The results showed that the scheme helped smallholder farmers increase the rice production and brought better market opportunities. The farmers’ net income was also increased. Profit generated from rice farming not only improved the livelihoods of smallholder farmers but also created more employment opportunities in the rural communities. The research also revealed that the scheme was faced with a number of challenges due to resource and institutional constraints and low-level human capacity for both management and members. The research provides a feasible approach to effective management of small-scale agricultural infrastructure for poverty reduction in Africa.

AB  - Continuous warming climate conditions have triggered numerous extreme weather events, exerting an unprecedented impact on agricultural and food production. Based on the panel data of 3,050 small farmers engaged in maize planting from 2009 to 2018 and collected by the National Rural Fixed Observation Point in China, this study uses the Transcendental Logarithmic Production Function model to estimate the impact of temperature, precipitation, and sunshine hours on maize output. Further, considering climate condition heterogeneity, this study analyzes the development potential of five major maize production areas in China. Results show that temperature and precipitation have a positive impact on maize output and that insufficient sunshine hour is an obstacle to the growth of maize output. Five major maize production areas are affected by climate condition differently, entailing the need for tailored response measures. Additionally, land, labor, and material capital input are key factors affecting maize output. Based on conclusion, we put forward the following suggestions to promote sustainable agricultural production, including strengthening the prediction of temperature, precipitation, and sunshine hours in major maize production areas, optimizing the agricultural production layout and the planting structure based on local endowment, enhancing farmers’ adaptive behavior training toward climate change, developing irrigation and water conservation projects.

AB  - Urbanization and aging of the agricultural population lead to the insufficient supply of agricultural labor and land being idle in rural China, calling for the farmland lease market to maintain sustainable and efficient use of farmland. However, rural households tend to agree on an uncertain term for farmland leasing in/out, which leads to low efficiency and land loss in agriculture. Therefore, using the survey data collected from 2704 rural households and a logistic regression model, we examine the effects of risk faced by the rural households on the likelihood of the uncertain term for farmland leasing. Results reveal that a large share of labor with low education and high income increase the likelihood of an uncertain term for farmland leasing out activities, while a high disaster frequency, a high education of household and a high share of agricultural income increase the probability of an uncertain term for farmland leasing in activities. Additionally, leasing farmland to/from relatives or neighbors, informal contracts, low rent and the lack of pension insurance also increase the likelihood of the uncertain term for farmland leasing out/in activities. Findings suggest that more attention should be paid to education, agricultural insurance and social security system in rural areas.
