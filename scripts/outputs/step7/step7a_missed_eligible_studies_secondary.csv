The farmers implemented diverse measures aimed at increasing access to water, reducing their need for irrigation water or obtaining a non-agricultural income. Less than one third of interviewed farmers were able to implement first-best adaptive measures, which involved little risk as farmers had secure access to alternative sources of water and to markets. The other farmers were unable to implement these measures. Half of the farmers opted for second-best measures, which involved risky attempts to increase access to water or to shift to other productions. Farmers also took other second-best adaptive measures that involved much less risk, such as non-agricultural activities, but that only provided a limited income.

Collected data were analyzed using propensity scores matching (PSM) and the analysis of variance (ANOVA) technique, using Tukey's method. PSM was utilized to compare farmers who adapted and those who did not, while the ANOVA test was applied to examine disparities in the impacts, resulting from the use of various adaptive measures. The study's findings demonstrated that changing rice varieties led to the most substantial increment in profitability (a 73% surge in profits) while adjusting the seasonal timetable was the least costly measure. Among the plausible combinations of adaptive measures, farmers achieved the highest additional yield by utilizing increased fertilizers and pesticides (yielding a 26% increase). However, the highest increase in profitability was observed by adjusting the seasonal calendar and modifying rice varieties (yielding a 124.2% surge in profits). Significant factors influencing farmers' choice of adaptive measures include the extent of formal education, farming experience, agricultural income, participation in training programs, membership in agricultural associations, and access to 7–10-day weather forecasts.

A standardized risk perception index was created using a four-point Likert scale against sixteen climatic events. In addition, a binary logit model was used to estimate the influence of socioeconomic characteristics of sample households on the decision to choose climate change adaptation strategies. Findings suggest that droughts, river erosion, and floods are the major climatic risks perceived by char dwellers. Additionally, results from a climate vulnerability index portray similar findings that char respondents are more exposed to diverse climatic hazards. The study further investigates local adaptation mechanisms in agriculture with regards to major climatic events. In response to the existing climate change risks, the char inhabitants employ several adaptation strategies in agriculture such as implementing new or alternative farming practices, changing planting times, and cultivating short-duration varieties. The llogit analysis suggests that household age, family size, annual income, farm size, farm ownership and farming experience have a significant influence on farmers' adaptation choices.

A better understanding of the processes that shape households’ adaptation decisions is essential for developing pertinent policies locally, thereby enabling better adaptation across scales and multiple stakeholders. This paper aims to examine the determinants of household decisions to adapt, it is also possible to target factors that facilitate or constrain adaptation. This helps to identify key components of current adaptive capacity, which leads to important insights into households’ competence to adapt in the future.


Design/methodology/approach
This paper takes a full-pledged approach examining factors and processes that shape households’ climate adaptation decision-making in rural Cambodia at three levels: adaptation status, adaptation intensity and choices of adaptation strategy. The three-stage analyses are materialized by applying the double hurdle model and multivariate probit model, which provides a potential way to systematically assess household adaptation decision-making in rural settings.


Findings
Results show a high level of involvement in adaptation among local households who are facing multiple stressors including climatic risks. The findings suggest that perceived climate change influence households’ decisions in both adaptation status and intensity. Access to financial credit, farmland size, water availability and physical asset holdings are identified as key factors promoting the adoption of more adaptation measures. To facilitate adaptation, collective effort and support at community level is important in providing knowledge based climate information dissemination and early warning systems. Public sector support and development aid programs should focus on positive triggers for targeted community and household adaptation.


Originality/value
The study, to the authors’ best knowledge, is one of the first studies to investigate the determinants of local adaptation decision-making systematically in Cambodia. It also provides a comprehensive approach to improve understanding of adaptation decision-making processes by exploring how various capital assets are associated with different stages of adaptation decisions.

Within the agricultural sector of many developing nations, farmers must make long-term decisions to adapt to climate change impacts in order to provide food security and sustainable livelihoods. However, deeper understanding of farmers’ decision-making, as a key stakeholder group, is of vital importance in forming adaptive land use policy ‘from the bottom-up’. This study investigates the psychosocial factors that influence farmers’ adaptation intention in the critical case of Marvdasht County in Iran – a case that exemplifies agricultural stakeholder decision-making in arid and drought-prone regions. We present a conceptual combination-model grounded in Protection Motivation Theory (PMT), employing a correlational survey among 256 farmer-stakeholders. First, we discuss the relative value of the combined model to understanding adaptation intentions. Second, we find that the factors that represent the externalities of farmers' behaviour need to be more thoroughly integrated in to adaptation planning. Third, we find that farmers’ adaptation intention is directly affected by maladaptation, and indirectly by economic disincentives, barriers to belief in anthropogenic climate change and broader risk perceptions.",,ok,elsevier_api,,,,,,2020,parsed_from_citation,include,pass,yes,farmers’ decision-making,True,yes,Adaptation to climate change is a matter of urgent social scientific analysis.,True,yes,Marvdasht County in Iran – a case that exemplifies agricultural stakeholder decision-making in arid and drought-prone regions,True,yes,employing a correlational survey among 256 farmer-stakeholders.,True,yes,Marvdasht County in Iran,True,"Ghanian, M., Ghoochani, O., Dehghanpour, M., Taqipour, M., Taheri, F., & Cotton, M.

The methods identified include use of different crop varieties, tree planting, soil conservation, early and late planting, and irrigation. Results from the discrete choice model employed indicate that the level of education, gender, age, and wealth of the head of household; access to extension and credit; information on climate, social capital, agroecological settings, and temperature all influence farmers’ choices.
