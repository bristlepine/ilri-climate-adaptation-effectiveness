This paper examines the short-term effects of adaptive measures taken by farmers in Suphanburi Province, Thailand, to deal with the major hydrological drought in 2015 and 2016. The farmers implemented diverse measures aimed at increasing access to water, reducing their need for irrigation water or obtaining a non-agricultural income. Less than one third of interviewed farmers were able to implement first-best adaptive measures, which involved little risk as farmers had secure access to alternative sources of water and to markets. The other farmers were unable to implement these measures. Half of the farmers opted for second-best measures, which involved risky attempts to increase access to water or to shift to other productions. Farmers also took other second-best adaptive measures that involved much less risk, such as non-agricultural activities, but that only provided a limited income. Therefore, based on their short-term effects, most adaptive actions could not be typified in terms of increasing or decreasing farmers’ vulnerability to drought, but far better in terms of the risks they involved.",,ok,elsevier_api,200,,2026-01-22T20:05:56Z,2026-01-22T20:05:56Z,0,2018,parsed_from_citation,include,,pass,,,yes,farmers to adapt to climate events,True,yes,adaptive measures taken by farmers,True,yes,hydrological drought in 2015 and 2016,True,yes,interviewed farmers were able to implement first-best adaptive measures,True,yes,"Suphanburi Province, Thailand",True,,,101016jijdrr201801032,Passed,Unknown,Peer Reviewed,,,,,,,True,True,"Pak-Uthai, S., Faysse, N.",International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction,2018,"Pak-Uthai, S., & Faysse, N.

This study investigated how smallholder farmers perceive climate change, what adaptation strategies they practice, and factors that influence their adaptation decisions. Both primary and secondary data were used for the study, and a multinomial logit model was employed to identify the factors that shape smallholder farmers’ adaptation strategies. The results show that 90% of farmers have already perceived climate variability, and 85% made attempts to adapt using practices like crop diversification, planting date adjustment, soil and water conservation and management, increasing the intensity of input use, integrating crop with livestock, and tree planting. The econometric model indicated that education, family size, gender, age, livestock ownership, farming experience, frequency of contact with extension agents, farm size, access to market, access to climate information and income were the key factors determining farmers’ choice of adaptation practice. In the Central Rift Valley of Ethiopia, climate change is a pressing problem, which is beyond the capacity of smallholders to respond to autonomously. Farmers’ capacity to choose effective adaptation options is influenced by household demography, as well as positively by farm size, income, access to markets, access to climate information and extension, and livestock production. This implies the need to support the indigenous adaptation strategies of the smallholder farmers with a wide range of institutional, policy, and technology support; some of it targeted on smaller, poorer or female-headed households. Moreover, creating opportunities for non-farm income sources is important as this helps farmers to engage in those activities that are less sensitive to climate change.

The model was tested in six villages situated in two administrative wards in the Morogoro region of Tanzania. The Mlali ward represents a system of relatively high agricultural potential, whereas the Gairo ward represents a system of low agricultural potential. A household survey, a rapid rural appraisal and, a stakeholder workshop were used for data collection. The data were analyzed using factor analysis, multiple linear regression, descriptive statistical methods and qualitative content analysis. The empirical results are discussed in the context of theoretical concepts of adaptation and the sustainable livelihood approach. We found that public investment in rural infrastructure, in the availability and technically efficient use of inputs, in a good education system that provides equal chances for women, and in the strengthening of social capital, agricultural extension and, microcredit services are the best means of improving the adaptation of the farmers from the six villages in Gairo and Mlali.

Collected data were analyzed using propensity scores matching (PSM) and the analysis of variance (ANOVA) technique, using Tukey's method. PSM was utilized to compare farmers who adapted and those who did not, while the ANOVA test was applied to examine disparities in the impacts, resulting from the use of various adaptive measures. The study's findings demonstrated that changing rice varieties led to the most substantial increment in profitability (a 73% surge in profits) while adjusting the seasonal timetable was the least costly measure. Among the plausible combinations of adaptive measures, farmers achieved the highest additional yield by utilizing increased fertilizers and pesticides (yielding a 26% increase). However, the highest increase in profitability was observed by adjusting the seasonal calendar and modifying rice varieties (yielding a 124.2% surge in profits). Significant factors influencing farmers' choice of adaptive measures include the extent of formal education, farming experience, agricultural income, participation in training programs, membership in agricultural associations, and access to 7–10-day weather forecasts.

The results further revealed that adoption of small-scale irrigation as an adaptation to climate change and variability is significantly and positively influenced by access to credit, social capital, and the educational status of household heads. Greater distance to marketplace and size of farmland negatively affected the use of agronomic practices, whereas crop failure experience and access to early warning systems have a positive influence.

Adaptation in the agriculture sector is needed to mitigate social, economic, and ecological impacts from increasing levels of hazard activity. To examine this issue, a household survey of 350 farmers in the Terai region of Nepal was carried out to assess farmers’ risk perceptions towards three common extreme weather events (floods, cold spells, and heat waves) and to explore their intended responses to cope with future impacts. The intended common adaptation strategies include changes in farm management, seeking off-farm employment, emergency management planning, purchasing crop insurance, and the raising of awareness. Threat appraisal is the strongest predictor of the number of intended adaptation strategies adopted in response to slow-onset hazards (heat waves and cold spells), while coping appraisal is the major predictor of the number of intended adaptation strategies adopted to mitigate flood risk, a rapid onset hazard. Crop insurance and off-farm employment are farmers’ most preferred flood adaptation strategies, while crop insurance is the most preferred adaptation strategy for heat waves and cold spells. Other variables such as the number of past implemented strategies, experience with extreme events, community organisation membership, and access to credit and extension services were also significantly associated with farmers’ choices for adaptation strategies in response to the three extreme events. This information can be used to tailor community-centred communication about potential threats from different extreme weather events and government technical and financial support, which will be crucial for farmers to adapt effectively to climate change-related weather extremes.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11069-020-04127-0,ok,landing_meta,200,,2026-01-22T20:04:54Z,2026-01-22T20:04:54Z,0,2020,parsed_from_citation,include,,pass,,,yes,Smallholder farmers in Nepal are vulnerable to climate change-related extreme weather events.,True,yes,"Adaptation in the agriculture sector is needed to mitigate social, economic, and ecological impacts from increasing levels of hazard activity.",True,yes,"floods, cold spells, and heat waves",True,yes,a household survey of 350 farmers in the Terai region of Nepal was carried out,True,yes,Terai region of Nepal,True,,,101007s11069020041270,Passed,Unknown,Peer Reviewed,,,,,,,True,True,"Budhathoki, N., Paton, D., Lassa, J. et al.",Natural Hazards,2020,"Budhathoki, N.

A distinction was made between coping and adaptation, as short-term responses to shocks and long-term responses to stressors, respectively. Binary logistic regression modeling was used based on a survey of 200 farmers. Socio-demographic, economic, biophysical, and institutional and infrastructural characteristics of the study setting and sample households were considered to identify key determinants of farmers’ choice of coping and adaptation strategies. This is premised on the fact that understanding significant determinants of farmers’ choice of coping and adaptation strategies is useful to design impactful adaptation interventions in the locality. The results showed that the significant factors affecting choice of adaptation strategies include perceived soil fertility status, perception of land tenure security, access to extension service, and ages of household heads. For the choice of coping options, agroecological zone, access to markets, farmer-to-farmer extension, landholding size, access to information on climate change, rainfall amount, and educational level of household heads were the significant determinants. Agroecological zone had negative influence to use selling livestock as coping strategy while the other variables had positive influences on farmers’ choice of coping and adaptation strategies. Off-farm income, community participation, ownership of livestock and temperature on the other hand had no significant influence on the choice of coping and adaptation strategies to climate change.

The present study evaluates char dwellers’ risk perceptions and agricultural adaptations to climate change. Survey data were collected from 98 households, and focus group discussions were conducted using a semi-structured questionnaire from Rydas Bari char under the Gaibandha District of Bangladesh. A standardized risk perception index was created using a four-point Likert scale against sixteen climatic events. In addition, a binary logit model was used to estimate the influence of socioeconomic characteristics of sample households on the decision to choose climate change adaptation strategies. Findings suggest that droughts, river erosion, and floods are the major climatic risks perceived by char dwellers. Additionally, results from a climate vulnerability index portray similar findings that char respondents are more exposed to diverse climatic hazards. The study further investigates local adaptation mechanisms in agriculture with regards to major climatic events. In response to the existing climate change risks, the char inhabitants employ several adaptation strategies in agriculture such as implementing new or alternative farming practices, changing planting times, and cultivating short-duration varieties. The llogit analysis suggests that household age, family size, annual income, farm size, farm ownership and farming experience have a significant influence on farmers' adaptation choices. Household access to education, early warning by extension agents, information on improved agricultural technologies, access to off-farm sources of income and incorporating char people during policy design can effectively enhance farmers’ resilience and help reduce vulnerability.",,ok,elsevier_api,200,,2026-01-22T20:04:35Z,2026-01-22T20:04:35Z,0,2021,parsed_from_citation,include,,pass,,,yes,Farmers in the riverine char islands of Bangladesh,True,yes,Agricultural adaptations to climate change,True,yes,"droughts, river erosion, and floods are the major climatic risks",True,yes,"Survey data were collected from 98 households, and focus group discussions",True,yes,Rydas Bari char under the Gaibandha District of Bangladesh,True,,,101016jlandusepol2021105295,Passed,Unknown,Peer Reviewed,,,,,,,True,True,"Ahmed, Z., Guha, G., Shew, A. et al.",Land Use Policy,2021,"Ahmed, Z., Guha, G., Shew, A., & Alam, G.

However, little research has focused on the investigation of vulnerability and adaptation to climate-related risks in Pakistan. Against this backdrop, this article investigates the farm level risk perceptions and different aspects of vulnerability to climate change including sensitivity and adaptive capacity at farm level in Pakistan. We interviewed a total of 450 farming households through structured questionnaires in three districts of Punjab province of Pakistan. This study identified a number of climate-related risks perceived by farm households such as extreme temperature events, insect attacks, animal diseases and crop pests. Limited water availability, high levels of poverty and a weak role of local government in providing proper infrastructure were the factors that make farmers more sensitive to climate-related risks. Uncertainty or reduction in crop and livestock yields; changed cropping calendars and water shortage were the major adverse impacts of climate-related risks reported by farmers in the study districts. Better crop production was reported as the only positive effect. Further, this study identified a number of farm level adaptation methods employed by farm households that include changes in crop variety, crop types, planting dates and input mix, depending upon the nature of the climate-related risks. Lack of resources, limited information, lack of finances and institutional support were some constraints that limit the adaptive capacity of farm households. This study also reveals a positive role of cooperation and negative role of conflict in the adaptation process. The study suggests to address the constraints to adaptation and to improve farm level cooperation through extended outreach and distribution of institutional services, particularly climate-specific farm advisory services.",,ok,elsevier_api,200,,2026-01-22T20:04:33Z,2026-01-22T20:04:33Z,0,2016,parsed_from_citation,include,,pass,,,yes,We interviewed a total of 450 farming households,True,yes,This article investigates the farm level risk perceptions and different aspects of vulnerability to climate change including sensitivity and adaptive capacity,True,yes,"The country has experienced many severe floods, droughts and storms over the last decades.",True,yes,We interviewed a total of 450 farming households through structured questionnaires,True,yes,in three districts of Punjab province of Pakistan.,True,,,101016jscitotenv201511125,Passed,Unknown,Peer Reviewed,,,,,,,True,True,"Abid, M., Schilling, J., Scheffran, J. et al.",Science of The Total Environment,2016,"Abid, M., Schilling, J., Scheffran, J., & Zulfiqar, F.

To do so, we apply an ex-ante approach based on the crop model SARRA-H coupled with an economic model that simulates the choice of cropping strategies among 24 available. The approach takes explicitly risk aversion into account and focuses on two different kinds of typical farmers with restricted and large adaptation capacities, in reference to the availability of viable decision options sensitive to forecast information. Results show (i) that 10-days forecasts alone or a combination of 10-days and seasonal forecasts could be quite beneficial for all types of farmers (e.g. median income change with 10-days forecast ranges from +1.8% to +13% according to adaptation possibilities), (ii) that in most of the cases farmers with access to fertilizers and larger arable land benefit more from forecasts and (iii) that even if seasonal forecasts are not really beneficial alone, they are when used in combination with 10-days forecasts. Despite these positive results, one has to underline that income losses may occur in about 20% of cases when using these forecasts, which may be a limiting factor to their effective adoption.",,ok,elsevier_api,200,,2026-01-22T20:04:28Z,2026-01-22T20:04:28Z,0,2016,parsed_from_citation,include,,pass,,,yes,Niger millet growers,True,yes,"adaptation capacities, in reference to the availability of viable decision options sensitive to forecast information.",True,yes,"crucial decisions based on some characteristics of the rainy season such as the onset, the offset, the cumulated rainfall or the occurrence of dry spells",True,yes,we apply an ex-ante approach based on the crop model SARRA-H coupled with an economic model that simulates the choice of cropping strategies,True,yes,Niger millet growers,True,,,101016jagrformet201604010,Passed,Unknown,Peer Reviewed,,,,,,,True,True,"Roudier, P., Alhassane, A., Baron, C. et al.",Agricultural and Forest Meteorology,2016,"Roudier, P., et al.

This article presents results from participatory research with farmers from two agro-ecological zones of Senegal, West Africa. Based on simulation exercises, the introduction of seasonal and dekadal forecasts induced changes in farmers’ practices in almost 75% of the cases. Responses were categorized as either implying pure intensification of cropping systems (21% of cases), non-intensified strategies (31%) or a mix of both (24%). Among non-intensified strategies, the most common forecast uses are changes in sowing date and crop variety with the latter being more prevalent where a wider repertoire of varieties existed. Mixed strategies generally used more inputs like manure or chemical fertilizers coupled with another strategy such as changing sowing date. Yield estimates suggest that forecast use led to yield gains in about one-third of the cases, with relatively few losses. Impacts varied according to the nature of the actual rainy season, forecasts accuracy and the type of response, positive ones being higher in wetter years, with intensified strategies and with accurate predictions. These results validate prior evidence that climate forecasts may be able to help Senegalese farmers adapt to climate variability, especially helping them capitalize on anticipated favorable conditions.

Likewise, the Midland was relatively more resilient with a mean index value of 0.461. Both the PCA and multiple regression analysis indicated that access to and use of livelihood resources, such as farmlands and livestock holdings, diversity of income sources, infrastructure and social capital were determinants of households’ resilience. In general, it might be due to their exposure to recurrent shocks coupled with limited adaptive capacities including underdeveloped public services, poor livelihood diversification practices, among others, the study communities showed minimal resilience capacity with a mean score of 0.44.

Based on farm household and Participatory Rural Appraisal data collected from districts in various agroecological zones in Kenya, this paper examines farmers' perceptions of climate change, ongoing adaptation measures, and factors influencing farmers' decisions to adapt. The results show that households face considerable challenges in adapting to climate change. While many households have made small adjustments to their farming practices in response to climate change (in particular, changing planting decisions), few households are able to make more costly investments, for example in agroforestry or irrigation, although there is a desire to invest in such measures. This emphasizes the need for greater investments in rural and agricultural development to support the ability of households to make strategic, long-term decisions that affect their future well-being.",,ok,elsevier_api,200,,2026-01-22T20:04:52Z,2026-01-22T20:04:52Z,0,2013,parsed_from_citation,include,,pass,,,yes,Based on farm household and Participatory Rural Appraisal data collected from districts in various agroecological zones in Kenya,True,yes,"this paper examines farmers' perceptions of climate change, ongoing adaptation measures, and factors influencing farmers' decisions to adapt.",True,yes,"Countries in Sub-Saharan Africa are particularly vulnerable to climate change, given dependence on agricultural production",True,yes,Based on farm household and Participatory Rural Appraisal data collected from districts in various agroecological zones in Kenya,True,yes,data collected from districts in various agroecological zones in Kenya,True,,,101016jjenvman201210036,Passed,Unknown,Peer Reviewed,,,,,,,True,True,"Bryan, E., Ringler, C., Okoba, B. et al.",Journal of Environmental Management,2013,"Bryan, E., Ringler, C., Okoba, B., Roncoli, C., Silvestri, S., & Herrero, M.

A better understanding of the processes that shape households’ adaptation decisions is essential for developing pertinent policies locally, thereby enabling better adaptation across scales and multiple stakeholders. This paper aims to examine the determinants of household decisions to adapt, it is also possible to target factors that facilitate or constrain adaptation. This helps to identify key components of current adaptive capacity, which leads to important insights into households’ competence to adapt in the future.


Design/methodology/approach
This paper takes a full-pledged approach examining factors and processes that shape households’ climate adaptation decision-making in rural Cambodia at three levels: adaptation status, adaptation intensity and choices of adaptation strategy. The three-stage analyses are materialized by applying the double hurdle model and multivariate probit model, which provides a potential way to systematically assess household adaptation decision-making in rural settings.


Findings
Results show a high level of involvement in adaptation among local households who are facing multiple stressors including climatic risks. The findings suggest that perceived climate change influence households’ decisions in both adaptation status and intensity. Access to financial credit, farmland size, water availability and physical asset holdings are identified as key factors promoting the adoption of more adaptation measures. To facilitate adaptation, collective effort and support at community level is important in providing knowledge based climate information dissemination and early warning systems. Public sector support and development aid programs should focus on positive triggers for targeted community and household adaptation.


Originality/value
The study, to the authors’ best knowledge, is one of the first studies to investigate the determinants of local adaptation decision-making systematically in Cambodia. It also provides a comprehensive approach to improve understanding of adaptation decision-making processes by exploring how various capital assets are associated with different stages of adaptation decisions. The findings contribute to policy implications enlightening adaptation planning at multi-scales with knowledge of key factors, which enhance local adaptive capacity to reduce climate change vulnerability.",,ok,semantic_scholar,200,,2026-01-22T20:05:21Z,2026-01-22T20:05:21Z,0,2020,parsed_from_citation,include,,pass,,,yes,households’ adaptation decisions,True,yes,determinants of household decisions to adapt,True,yes,households’ decisions in both adaptation status and intensity.,True,yes,double hurdle model and multivariate probit model,True,yes,rural Cambodia,True,,,101108ijccsm0120190004,Passed,Unknown,Peer Reviewed,,,,,,,True,True,"Jiao, X., Zheng, Y., Liu, Z.",International Journal of Climate Change Strategies and Management,2020,"Jiao, X., Zheng, Y., & Liu, Z.

Understanding determinants of smallholder farming practices is critical for designing and implementing successful interventions, including climate change adaptation programs. We examine two dimensions wherein smallholder farmers may adapt agricultural practices; through intensification (i.e., adopt more practices) or diversification (i.e. adopt different practices). We use data on 5314 randomly sampled households located in 38 sites in 15 countries across four regions (East and West Africa, South Asia, and Central America). We estimate empirical models designed to assess determinants of both intensification and diversification of adaptation activities at global scales. Aspects of adaptive capacity that are found to increase intensification of adaptation globally include variables associated with access to information and human capital, financial considerations, assets, household infrastructure and experience. In contrast, there are few global drivers of adaptive diversification, with a notable exception being access to weather information, which also increases adaptive intensification. Investigating reasons for adaptation indicate that conditions present in underdeveloped markets provide the primary impetus for adaptation, even in the context of climate change. We also compare determinants across spatial scales, which reveals a variety of local avenues through which policy interventions can relax economic constraints and boost agricultural adaptation for both intensification and diversification. For example, access to weather information does not affect intensification adaptation in Africa, but is significant at several sites in Bangladesh and India.

The applicability of the integrated model is explored by means of a representative sample survey of smallholder farmers in northern Ethiopia. The result of the study showed that there is a statistically significant association between farmer’s behavioral intention to undertake farm-level risk-reduction measures and the main important protection motivation model variables.

However, in the agricultural sector, and particularly in least developed countries (LDCs), concerns remain as to whether these policies and programmes are consistent with farmers’ preferences. This study empirically investigates Nepalese farmers’ willingness to support the implementation of adaptation programmes. To this end, we first developed suggested adaptation programmes in accordance with the adaptation measures identified by LDCs in their National Adaptation Programmes of Actions. We then employed a choice experiment framework to estimate farmers’ willingness to pay (WTP) for adaptation benefits. The findings indicate that the substantial benefits of the adaptation programmes for farmers result in a sizeable WTP to participate, which would appear to justify the programmes’ widespread implementation.Key policy insights Farmers are willing to participate in, and contribute to, the suggested adaptation programmes in the form of increased access to climate adaptive crop species and varieties, improved soil quality and irrigation and the provision of training in climate adaptive farming.Key socio-economic factors influence farmers’ support of adaptation programmes. Older farmers, those households closer to government extension services, larger land holders, those involved in household labour exchange, farmers located in drought and flood-prone regions and those who perceive that the climate has changed are more likely to participate.The more farmers are aware of climate change impacts, the greater their preference for adaptation programmes. Increasing farmer awareness prior to implementation of such programmes is therefore an obvious means of further raising participation rates.",https://doi.org/10.1080/14693062.2017.1389688,ok,openalex,200,,2026-01-22T20:05:31Z,2026-01-22T20:05:31Z,0,2017,parsed_from_citation,include,,pass,,,yes,Nepalese farmers,True,yes,willingness to support the implementation of adaptation programmes,True,yes,"climate adaptive crop species and varieties, improved soil quality and irrigation and the provision of training in climate adaptive farming.",True,yes,We then employed a choice experiment framework,True,yes,Nepalese farmers,True,,,1010801469306220171389688,Passed,Unknown,Peer Reviewed,,,,,,,True,True,"Khanal, U., Wilson, C., Lee, B. et al.",Climate Policy,2017,"Khanal, U., Wilson, C., Lee, B., & Hoang, V.-N.
